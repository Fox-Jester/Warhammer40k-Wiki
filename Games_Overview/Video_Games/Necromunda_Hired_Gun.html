            <h2>Gameplay</h2>
            <p>
              Necromunda: Hired Gun is a first-person shooter game, where the
              player plays as a mercenary who is seeking to uncover a conspiracy
              involving a powerful gang in Necromunda's underworld. The game is
              linear, with stages that can be played through normally, later the
              player can take on contracts that require them to complete
              specific tasks in portions of the level.
            </p>
            <p>
              The player can choose multiple ranged weapons, with upgrades
              available for them. The player can execute an enemy using a melee
              finisher if they're within a certain range. The game focuses on
              maintaining momentum, with the player able to use a grappling
              hook, dash around enemies and wall run. The game has platforming
              sections scattered throughout the game that require the use of
              these abilities. The game features stealth mechanics where the
              player can sneak past enemies to avoid detection. The player has a
              combat dog, which can be used to spot and attack enemies, and can
              be upgraded to improve its abilities and to gain new ones. The end
              of each level culminates in a boss fight.
            </p>
            <p>
              Martyr's End is the central hub area, where players gain access to
              levels and can pick out contracts. The hub serves as the area
              where much of the game's story and side quests exist. The player
              can also purchase weapons, abilities and upgrades at the shops
              around the area.
