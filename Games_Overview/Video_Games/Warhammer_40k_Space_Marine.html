            Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine takes place in Games Workshop's
            Warhammer 40,000 universe and features the Ultramarines chapter. Its
            gameplay focuses on a hybrid shooting and melee combat model. The
            game received generally mixed-to-positive reviews from critics. A
            sequel, Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine II, released in 2024.

            <h2>Gameplay</h2>
            <p>
              In Space Marine, the player engages enemies in both melee and at
              range from a third-person point of view. The player character,
              Demetrian Titus, has a shield and regenerative abilities. When his
              health gets low, performing some actions can allow Titus to regain
              a portion of his health. Titus is accompanied by the characters
              Sidonus and Leandros for most of the game, though some missions
              are performed alone. The game features a fury meter that, when
              filled up, grants rapid health regeneration and stronger melee
              attacks. This ability can later be upgraded with purity seals to
              improve its duration, the rate at which it recharges, and the
              effectiveness of ranged attacks (slow motion when zoomed, a faster
              fire rate and increased damage). Titus acquires a jet pack which
              provides short bursts of uplifted movements.
            </p>
            <p>
              The starting weapons include a combat knife and a bolt pistol,
              though the player can acquire other weapons. The game also
              includes a new weapon not featured in the table-top game known as
              the Vengeance Launcher, which can shoot sticky fusion grenades.
            </p>
            <p>
              The game's main antagonists are the Orks and the Forces of Chaos.
              The Orks are an alien race of brutish warriors. The Forces of
              Chaos are traitor Space Marines who follow the Gods of Chaos, and
              can summon daemons that live in a parallel dimension known as The
              Warp. Portals conjured by the Traitor Legions allow daemons to
              enter the battlefield.
