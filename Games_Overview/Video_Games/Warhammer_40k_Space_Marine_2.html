          </p>
          <section class="info-box contained">
            <h2>Gameplay</h2>
            <p>
              In Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine II, the player engages enemies
              using a mix of both melee and ranged combat from a third-person
              point of view. The player controls Titus, a lieutenant of the
              Ultramarines chapter and returning protagonist from the first
              game. Titus is accompanied by fellow Space Marines Chairon and
              Gadriel throughout the campaign who can be controlled by other
              players in the game's cooperative multiplayer mode or by
              artificial intelligence (AI) in single player.
            </p>
            <p>
              The game utilizes ranged combat when facing weaker enemies (such
              as Tyranid Gaunts), while hack and slash combat is required when
              fighting more powerful enemies (such as the Tyranid warrior) that
              can block incoming projectile damage. Players can parry an
              opponent's attack, though some hostile attacks are unblockable and
              therefore must be dodged. Additionally, the player can fight
              alongside imperial guard foot soldiers controlled by AI throughout
              sections of the game. Titus is protected by armor. When his armor
              breaks, his health will drop permanently when he is attacked.
              Health will only replenish when the player recovers medkits in the
              game's battlefield. His armor, however, will regenerate after
              Titus performs an execution attack on an enemy. If a character's
              health is depleted the character will drop to the ground and bleed
              out for 30 seconds during which other characters can revive them
              before they die.
            </p>
            <p>
              The game also supports a separate cooperative mode named
              "Operations‚Äù, and three 6v6 competitive multiplayer modes
              (Annihilation, Seize Ground, and Capture and Control). Players can
              choose from six different character classes and freely customize
              their player avatar with various cosmetic items.
