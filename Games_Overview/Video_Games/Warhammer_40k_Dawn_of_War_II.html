            Warhammer 40,000: Dawn of War II is a real-time strategy-tactical
            role-playing video game developed by Relic Entertainment and
            published by THQ for Microsoft Windows based on the fictional
            Warhammer 40,000 universe. It is the sequel to the Warhammer 40,000:
            Dawn of War video game series. Dawn of War II was released in North
            America on February 19, 2009 and in Europe on February 20, 2009. A
            sequel, Warhammer 40,000: Dawn of War III, was released in April
            2017.

            <h2>Gameplay</h2>
            <p>
              Playable armies at the initial release of the game include the
              Space Marines, Orks, Eldar, and Tyranids. The Chaos Space Marines
              and the Imperial Guard were later added to the game through its
              two expansion packs.
            </p>
            <p>
              The gameplay of Dawn of War II is markedly different from that of
              Dawn of War and its expansions. Building bases is completely
              removed. Jonny Ebbert, the game's lead designer, describes the
              feel of the game by saying that it "takes everything that was
              great about the original and combines it with the best that
              Company of Heroes had to offer." There is a heavier focus on
              cover, which gives more substantial defensive bonuses.
              Accordingly, there is also new emphasis on methods of dealing with
              units in cover. Some weapons, such as grenades and other
              explosives, can destroy cover, while others, such as flamers,
              ignore cover bonuses completely. Other differences between Dawn of
              War II and its predecessors include improved unit AI (squads under
              fire seek cover, for example), more realistically sized vehicles,
              and an improved physics engine, though the AI is easy to
              manipulate, by means such as placing suppression squads which the
              AI will instantly know have been placed and avoid, thus allowing
              to funnel the army to the player needs. This game also includes a
              fall back command which the AI will use somewhat liberally, making
              the squad or command unit fall back at a higher speed and become
              resistant to range damage while being more vulnerable to melee.
            </p>
            <p>
              As a Games for Windows - Live game, the game uses the Achievements
              system from Xbox Live, and is the first widely released,
              PC-exclusive game to use it. Because of this, a player must be
              able to connect to the Windows Live servers in order to access the
              game's multiplayer features. The game also requires authentication
              via Steam. On June 17, 2014, an optional update was released that
              removes Games for Windows Live and the defunct GameSpy multiplayer
              servers for Steam solutions, including Steam Cloud.
