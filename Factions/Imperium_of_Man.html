          <h2>Imperium of Man!</h2>
          <div class="logo-box">
            <img src="../images/Iom logo.webp" alt="" />
          </div>
          <p>
            The Imperium of Man, also occasionally called the Imperium of
            Mankind and simply the Imperium, is the galactic empire under which
            the majority of humanity is united.
          </p>

          <p>
            The founder and nominal ruler of the Imperium is the god-like
            Emperor of Mankind, the most powerful human psyker ever known. The
            Imperium is the largest and most powerful political entity in the
            galaxy, consisting of at least a million worlds which are dispersed
            across most of the galaxy. An Imperial planet might be separated
            from its closest neighbour by hundreds or thousands of light years.
            As a stellar empire, the size of the Imperium cannot be measured in
            terms of contiguous territory, but only in the number of planetary
            systems in its control.
          </p>
          <p>
            The Imperium controls countless worlds, somewhere between a million,
            millions, a billion or even billions in total. The overall number of
            planets has never been exactly determined, entire departments of the
            Administratum are devoted to cataloguing every controlled world, a
            task without end, due to the constantly changing nature of the
            domain.
          </p>
          <p>
            New planets are constantly discovered, conquered or colonised while
            old ones are lost The Imperium also controls untold millions of
            stars.
          </p>
          <p>
            Several aliens and forces - Chaos, Tyranids, Eldar, Dark Eldar,
            Orks, Tau, Necrons - challenge the supremacy of the Imperium. From
            within, the Imperium is threatened more insidiously by rebellion,
            mutation, rogue psykers, and subversive cults. Without the
            protection of the Imperium, mankind would fall prey to the countless
            perils that threaten it
          </p>

            <h3>Astra Militarum</h3>
            <img src="../images/astra_militarum.jpg" alt="" />
          </div>
          <p>
            The Astra Militarum, also known as the Imperial Guard in colloquial
            Low Gothic, is the largest coherent fighting force in the galaxy and
            serves as the Imperium of Man's primary military force and first
            line of defence from the myriad threats which endanger the existence
            of the Human race in the 41st Millennium.
          </p>
          <p>
            It is comprised of countless billions of men and women -- hundreds
            of thousands of different regiments, supported by a vast array of
            light and heavy armoured vehicles that provide the Imperial Guard's
            primary offensive punch. The Astra Militarum is usually the first
            Imperial force to respond to a threat if a world's Planetary Defence
            Force (PDF) fails to suppress it.
          </p>
          <p>
            They also garrison major locations of strategic or cultural interest
            to the Imperium and are often found in defensive roles. Supported by
            legions of heavy armour and thundering artillery, the Imperial Guard
            fight a never-ending war for the survival of Mankind in an
            unrelentingly hostile universe.
          </p>
          <p>
            The primary combat tactic of the Astra Militarum is to overwhelm the
            enemy with their endless numbers, while at the same time hammer them
            into submission with devastating artillery and crush them with
            powerful main battle tanks. As a result, the Astra Militarum is
            often referred to as the "Hammer of the Emperor" -- the sheer amount
            of force that the Imperial Guard can bring to bear on the enemy is
            devastating, but is not as direct or as precise as their Space
            Marine allies in the Adeptus Astartes, who are described as the
            "Scalpel of the Emperor" and specialise in planetary assaults,
            special operations and decapitation strikes.
          </p>
          <p>
            There is no universal uniform or regimental command hierarchy in the
            Astra Militarum, although it is compulsory for every regiment to
            have at least one commissar to maintain the discipline and morale of
            the troops while watching for any signs of corruption or heretical
            taint in the ranks. However, it is worth noting that a number of
            worlds copy the uniform and equipment used by the regiments of the
            Cadian Shock Troops, who are viewed as being the most effective of
            the Astra Militarum's infantry units.
          </p>
          <p>
            The origins of the Astra Militarum date back to the Great Crusade of
            the late 30th Millennium, when the Emperor of Mankind conquered the
            stars and forged the Imperium of Man. On the front line of this
            mission of expansion and reclamation were the Space Marine Legions
            -- the Adeptus Astartes -- the finest warriors Humanity had ever
            created, each the equal of a dozen normal men.
          </p>
          <p>
            Despite their formidable battle prowess, the forces of the Space
            Marines were not limitless, and the relentless demands of building a
            galactic empire pushed the Legions further apart. Separated by
            countless thousands of light years, their presence became ever more
            scattered and dilute.
          </p>
          <p>
            The Emperor required more manpower to ensure the momentum of the
            Great Crusade did not falter, and so the Imperial Army was created,
            known in High Gothic as the Imperialis Auxilia.
          </p>
          <p>
            The Imperial Army was a vital part of the expedition fleets sent out
            to claim the stars in the Emperor's name. Gargantuan numbers of
            brave troops -- millions growing to billions of troops, ranks of
            armoured battle tanks and mighty armadas of capital-class starships
            that were a part of the Imperial Army's subsidary Armada Imperialis
            -- were raised, all subordinate to the Legiones Astartes.
          </p>
          <p>
            At first, the Imperial Army was employed for garrison duties and to
            mop up resistance in the wake of the Legions' initial assaults,
            utilised where the back of an enemy was broken and Compliance to the
            Imperium required only a watchful presence.
          </p>
          <p>
            Eventually, certainly by the time the Great Crusade reached the
            Eastern Fringe of the galaxy, the troops and starships of the
            Imperial Army were deployed at its forefront, fighting alongside the
            power-armoured super-soldiers of the Legiones Astartes. But
            everything changed when the galaxy was ripped asunder by the
            treachery of the Warmaster Horus, triggering a cataclysmic
            interstellar civil war that engulfed the newly-founded Imperium.
          </p>
          <p>
            In the aftermath of this so-called Horus Heresy, the organisational
            structure of the forces of the Imperium were revised significantly.
            To prevent the possibility of large-scale rebellion occurring again
            within the Imperial armed forces, the titanic armies of the Imperium
            were divided.
          </p>
          <p>
            The nine remaining Loyalist Space Marine Legions were split into
            Chapters. The Imperial Army, as it was, ceased to exist. The link
            between fleet and army was severed; never again would ground
            commanders be given direct control over interstellar warships. From
            its ashes were born the Imperial Navy and the Imperial Guard --
            known officially as the Astra Militarum.
          </p>
          <p>
            The Astra Militarum was reorganised into planetary-sized units known
            as "Militarum Regimentos," which in turn were divided into smaller
            regiments. Commissars of the Officio Prefectus, based on the
            Imperial Army's former "masters of discipline," were introduced to
            ensure loyalty and discipline.
          </p>
          <p>
            The interdependence of the newly formed Astra Militarum with the
            now-separate Imperial Navy ensured that, should a regiment turn
            against their oaths to the Emperor, they would not be able to spread
            their treachery beyond a single world, and should a Navy fleet
            mutiny then they would not have the ability to re-supply or deploy
            ground troops.
          </p>
          <p>
            The Imperium had learnt a painful lesson from the dark days of the
            Horus Heresy, one its rulers were determined never to repeat in the
            grim days to come.

          <div class="info-card">
            <h3>Space Marines</h3>
            <img src="../images/space_marine.jpg" alt="" />
          </div>
          <p>
            The Space Marines or Adeptus Astartes are foremost amongst the
            defenders of Humanity, the greatest of the Emperor of Mankind's
            warriors. They are barely Human at all, but superhuman; having been
            made superior in all respects to a normal man by a harsh regime of
            genetic modification, psycho-conditioning and rigorous training.
          </p>
          <p>
            Space Marines are untouched by plague or any natural disease and can
            suffer wounds that would kill a lesser being several times over, and
            live to fight again. Clad in ancient power armour and wielding the
            most potent weapons known to man, the Space Marines are terrifying
            foes and their devotion to the Emperor and the Imperium of Man is
            unyielding. They are the God-Emperor's Angels of Death, and they
            know no fear.
          </p>
          <p>
            The Astartes are physically stronger, far more resilient and often
            mentally far removed from the lot of most normal Human beings. In
            the presence of the Astartes, most people feel a combination of awe
            and fear, and many cultures on the more primitive worlds simply
            worship them outright as demigods or angels of the God-Emperor made
            flesh.
          </p>
          <p>
            They should feel so, for many Space Marines feel little compassion
            for those they have sometimes termed "mortals" in comparison to
            themselves, seeing the very people they were created to protect as
            little more than obstacles to a more efficient eradication of the
            Imperium's enemies.

            This is an attitude sometimes taken by whole Chapters. They see
            normal Humans as frail, weak creatures given to the follies of
            temptation, avarice, greed, lust and cowardice -- all emotions they
            rarely feel, if ever.
          </p>
          <p>
            Yet there are some Astartes who remember why they were created by
            the Emperor, who avoid the trap of hubris which the Space Marines
            are so prone to and which has seduced so many of their number to
            serve the Ruinous Powers of Chaos. They are the final guardians of
            Mankind, the saviours of last resort.
          </p>
          <p>
            They were intended not to lead Humanity, but to defend it, sometimes
            even from itself. At the heart of that mission lies the limitless
            compassion the Emperor extended to every man and woman in the galaxy
            when He willingly chose to condemn Himself to more than 10,000 years
            of imprisonment within a dying prison of flesh for their sake.
          </p>
          <p>
            Some Astartes sneer at compassion, seeing it as one more Human
            weakness that has been purged from their superior transhuman bodies
            and minds. But the wisest of the Space Marines know that in the end,
            compassion is their only salvation.
          </p>
          <p>
            Potential Space Marines are usually, but not always, recruited from
            the worlds where a Chapter has established its fortress-monastery,
            although some Chapters are known to recruit from a collection of
            different worlds in an area of space that they protect or frequent.
          </p>
          <p>
            Recruiting methods vary from Chapter to Chapter. Some select their
            neophytes from feral tribes roaming the surface of inhospitable
            worlds, while others draw upon eager volunteers who have been
            groomed from birth to become an Astartes.
          </p>
          <p>
            Still others watch and kidnap potential warriors, turning them into
            Astartes whether they will it or not. Whatever the method, all Space
            Marine Chapters will only accept those who successfully pass the
            grueling initiation trials and prove themselves worthy of becoming a
            Space Marine.
          </p>
          <p>
            However a man becomes a Space Marine does not matter: once his body
            has been forged into that of a transhuman Astartes, he must forever
            stand apart from the people to whom he was once kin and who he is
            now sworn to protect. Once a man becomes a Space Marine, he is no
            longer mortal; his genetic heritage is now that of the Emperor
            Himself, and a spark of the same divine majesty flows in his veins.
          </p>
          <p>
            There are approximately 1,000 Space Marine Chapters active in the
            Imperium of Man at any one time. Since the opening of the Great Rift
            in the Era Indomitus, these Chapters have been comprised of a
            mixture of traditional Firstborn Space Marines and the even more
            enhanced Primaris Space Marines, or may contain only Primaris
            Marines.
          </p>
          <p>
            A list of the most notable and well-known Chapters in the Imperium
            can be found here. This number has stayed relatively constant since
            the Second Founding in the 31st Millennium following the Horus
            Heresy when the First Founding Space Marine Legions were broken up.
          </p>
          <p>
            However, the exact population of Astartes in the galaxy remains far
            from exact and may fluctuate widely depending on the time period and
            the circumstances confronting the Imperium.

          <div class="info-card">
            <h3>Adeptus Mechanicus</h3>
            <img src="../images/adeptus mechanicus.jpg" alt="" />
          </div>
          <p>
            The Adeptus Mechanicus is the official Imperial name within the
            Adeptus Terra for the Cult Mechanicus or Cult of the Machine based
            on Mars which provides the Imperium with its scientists, engineers
            and technicians.
          </p>
          <p>
            The tech-adepts of the Mechanicus are the primary keepers of what is
            viewed as sacred wisdom, a privileged caste of Tech-priests who
            jealously guard the knowledge required to maintain and construct
            much of the Imperium's advanced technology.
          </p>
          <p>
            In ancient times, before the current Age of the Imperium officially
            began following the end of the Horus Heresy, the Adeptus Mechanicus
            was instead called the Mechanicum. The Adeptus Mechanicus was
            formally separated from the larger Mechanicum of Mars by order of
            the Council of Terra in 012.M31. This occurred after the Red Planet
            had fallen to the control of the Hereteks who represented the
            Traitor faction of the Mechanicum loyal to the Warmaster Horus later
            called the "Dark Mechanicum."
          </p>
          <p>
            The Mechanicus acknowledge the Emperor of Mankind as the ruler of
            the Imperium of Man, but not the religious truth of the Imperial
            Cult or the Ecclesiarchy, and are granted an unusual amount of
            political and religious autonomy within the Imperium's structure, a
            role protected by the ancient Treaty of Mars. The Mechanicus
            essentially maintains an empire-within-an-empire in Imperial space,
            and its interests usually, but not always, coincide with those of
            the wider Imperium.
          </p>
          <p>
            Instead of the Imperial Creed, the servants of the Mechanicus follow
            their own dark and mysterious scriptures and worship the strange
            deity they call the Machine God or the "Omnissiah."
          </p>
          <p>
            As part of this faith, the Adeptus Mechanicus believes knowledge is
            the true manifestation of divinity in the universe, and all
            creatures and artefacts that embody knowledge are holy because of
            it. The Emperor is the supreme object of worship for the servants of
            the Mechanicus, for He is the living avatar of the Machine God that
            is the Omnissiah.
          </p>
          <p>
            The Emperor was recognised by the ancient Mechanicum as the
            fulfillment of the prophecy of the coming of the Omnissiah because
            He comprehends so much, and understands more about the true nature
            of reality than any other being in existence.
          </p>
          <p>
            The Tech-priests of the Adeptus Mechanicus also regard organic flesh
            as weak and view the removal and replacement of biological tissue
            with mechanical, bionic parts as sacred. Most elder Tech-priests
            have few organic parts left and eventually become more machine than
            man.
          </p>
          <p>
            The Adeptus Mechanicus is based on Mars, the very first Forge World
            of the Imperium, and they are the sole rulers of the Red Planet.
            They provide the technical and scientific experts of the Imperium
            and field armies of massive Titans, Questor Mechanicus Knights,
            Electro-priests, Skitarii and Combat Servitors.
