          <p>
            Chaos, also known to its servants as the Primordial Truth or the
            Primordial Annihilator, and to the Imperium of Man as the Archenemy,
            is a metaphysical, psychic force embodied by the malevolent entities
            comprised of emotional energy that exist in the Immaterium.
          </p>
          <p>
            The entities who embody Chaos are mostly Daemons, but the term also
            encompasses those mortals who pursue the goals of Chaos, ranging
            from simple peasants and/or manufactorum labourers who serve as
            Chaos Cultists, to Traitoris Militarum, planetary militia, Imperial
            nobles, planetary governors, and even the mighty Chaos Space Marines
            and Hereteks, Traitor Titan Legions and Chaos Knights of the Dark
            Mechanicum.
          </p>
          <p>
            Chaos is also itself the turbulent psychic energy that comprises the
            alternate dimension known as the Immaterium. It gives shape to the
            nightmare domains of the individual Chaos Gods that are collectively
            called the Realm of Chaos by scholars of the Inquisition. Chaos is
            almost synonymous with the Warp -- the two concepts are inseparable,
            for Chaos is the limitless ocean of spiritual, psychic and emotional
            energy that defines the Immaterium and underlies the 4-dimensional
            material universe of space-time.

          <p>
            The Chaos Gods, also called the Dark Gods or the Ruinous Powers, are
            powerful, self-aware entities comprised solely of psychic energy who
            inhabit and control the psychic dimension that underlies all
            physical reality known as the Immaterium or the "Warp."
          </p>
          <p>
            The Chaos Gods are in truth not really divine beings, though their
            great power often means there is little difference for those mortals
            who revere them. These Warp entities are created and sustained by
            the emotions and collective desires of every sentient being of the
            material universe. When an emotion or belief in realspace grows
            strong or widespread enough across the galaxy, it becomes embodied
            as one of the sentient denizens of the Warp.

          <p>
            The most powerful and most malevolent of these have become the Gods
            of Chaos. Although they are god-like beings, the Dark Gods are by
            their nature monomaniacal and completely single-minded since they
            are formed entirely of a single emotion or concept.
          </p>
          <p>
            The Chaos Gods are dependent upon the emotions of mortal creatures,
            especially the hordes of Humanity, for their power and continued
            existence. As a result, the Chaos Gods strive to convert all mortals
            to their worship and service so that they may ultimately dominate
            the universe. However, if they were to win such a dark victory, it
            would likely destroy all of reality when the dimensional separation
            between realspace and the Immaterium broke down in its wake.
          </p>
          <p>
            The Chaos Gods and the forces of Chaos that serve them are the
            greatest enemies of the Imperium of Man, the Aeldari and most other
            sentient forms of life in the Milky Way Galaxy, even if they are not
            fully aware yet of the threat Chaos poses, like the T'au Empire.
          </p>
          <p>
            The Chaos Gods are able to devote a fraction of their psychic power
            in the Warp to create Daemons, psychic entities whose appearance and
            character reflect their patron god's own nature.
          </p>
          <p>
            These Daemons may be reabsorbed into the god at their whim. The
            least of the minor Chaos Gods may be so limited in their power that
            expending that power to create a Daemon means their entire power is
            expended; in effect, the god becomes a Daemon.
          </p>
          <p>
            In the Warp, the psychic reflection of similar thoughts and emotions
            gather together like rivulets of water running down a cliff face.
            They form streams and eddies of anguish and desire, pools of hatred
            and torrents of pride.
          </p>
          <p>
            Since the dawn of time, these tides and waves of psychic energy have
            flowed unceasingly through the mirror realm of the Warp, and such is
            their power that they forged creatures made of the very stuff of
            dreams and nightmares.
          </p>
          <p>
            Eventually, these instinctual, formless entities gained a
            rudimentary consciousness of their own. The Chaos Gods were born --
            vast psychic presences composed of the fantasies and horrors of
            mortals. These are the Ruinous Powers, and each one is a reflection
            of the mortal passions that formed them.
          </p>
          <p>
            First amongst them is Khorne, the Lord of Battle, possessed of
            towering and immortal fury. Tzeentch, the bizarre and ever-changing
            Architect of Fate, weaves powerful sorceries to bind the future to
            his will, whilst great Nurgle, the Lord of Decay, labours endlessly
            to spread infection and pestilence. The last of their number is
            Slaanesh, the Dark Prince of Chaos, indulgent of every pleasure and
            excess, no matter how immoral or perverse.
          </p>
          <p>
            As the intelligent species of the Milky Way Galaxy prospered and
            grew, so too did their hopes and ambitions, their anger and wars,
            their love and hatred. This burgeoning flood of raw emotion fed the
            Chaos Gods and nurtured their power.
          </p>
          <p>
            Before long, the gods reached back to their makers with a curious
            and hungry sentience, planting seeds of corruption in the souls of
            those whose dreams they passed through. So were the first mortals
            bound to the will of the Ruinous Powers, and seeing the fruits of
            their labours, the gods began their eternal work to influence the
            physical realm and its myriad sentient races.
          </p>
          <p>
            Lured by promises of extraordinary power and immortality, some
            mortals serve the Chaos Gods willingly, fomenting misery, war and
            death amongst their people in order to sustain and elevate their
            dark masters. Yet the Chaos Gods are fickle, prone to reneging or
            altering a deal on a whim, and few of these worshippers are ever
            granted the rewards they seek.
          </p>
          <p>
            A Chaos God can only grow in power through the actions and thoughts
            of mortals. Those who worship a Chaos God, and behave in a way that
            feeds it, are rewarded with strange "gifts," extraordinary powers
            and potentially, immortality as a Daemon Prince. As the Chaos Gods
            battle in the Warp, so their mortal followers wage war in the
            material universe.
          </p>
          <p>
            The victors of the battles earn more power for their unworldy
            master, though the twisted plans of the Chaos Gods are such that
            often victory is not necessary; merely the acts of sacrifice and
            battle themselves.
          </p>
          <p>
            When devotees of Chaos die, their souls do not fade in the Warp and
            disappear like the spirits of others to some unknown and unknowable
            fate. Instead, their immortal energy is swallowed into the greatness
            of their gods, their souls sustained forever, bound to the eternal
            power of Chaos.
          </p>
          <p>
            As a Chaos God gathers such energy, it expands in power, and its
            influence and territory within the Warp's Realm of Chaos grows. As
            extensions of the gods, the appearances of these domains are formed
            upon the same emotions that created their masters: Khorne's realm is
            founded on anger and bloodletting; Tzeentch's lands are
            scintillating constructs of pure magic; Nurgle's territory is a
            haven of death and regeneration, and Slaanesh's dominion is a
            paradise of damning temptations.
          </p>
          <p>
            Though realm and god are as one, the Chaos Gods each have a form
            that embodies their personalities and dwells at the very heart of
            their territories. Wreathed in unearthly power, the Chaos Gods watch
            over their realms, seeking any disturbances in the pattern of the
            Warp that signal intrusion or opportunity

            Chaos Space Marines, also sometimes called Traitor Marines, Renegade
            Marines, or Heretic Astartes, are former Space Marines of the
            Imperium of Man who have chosen to abandon the service of the
            Emperor of Mankind and dedicate themselves to Chaos to achieve their
            own ends.

            Such corrupt Astartes usually belong to one of the nine original
            Traitor Legions that betrayed the Emperor during the ancient civil
            war called the Horus Heresy more than 10,000 standard years ago,
            while others come from Space Marine Chapters created long after the
            Heresy ended that have turned Renegade. Chaos can corrupt Astartes
            of any time and place just as its siren call leads many lesser men
            and women to their damnation.During the Horus Heresy, the terrible
            Imperial civil war that pitted the battle-brothers of the 18 known
            Space Marine Legions against one another, there were two factions.
            These were the Loyalist Space Marines who continued to serve the
            Imperium and the Emperor of Mankind and the Chaos Space Marines of
            the Traitor Legions who betrayed the Emperor and pledged their souls
            to the service of the four Ruinous Powers of Chaos.

            During the Horus Heresy, the terrible Imperial civil war that pitted
            the battle-brothers of the 18 known Space Marine Legions against one
            another, there were two factions. These were the Loyalist Space

            four Ruinous Powers of Chaos.
          </p>
          <p>
            Some Traitor Marines pledged their service to all four of the Dark
            Gods, a malevolent force known as Chaos Undivided, whilst others
            preferred to dedicate themselves to the worship of only one of the
            Ruinous Powers. The Traitor Legions were led by the Warmaster Horus,
            once a primarch of the Imperium and the Emperor's most trusted
            friend, son, and adviser before he was corrupted by the promises and
            lies of the Dark Gods and his own inner flaws and ambition.
          </p>
          <p>
            The Traitor Legions were the most powerful component of the forces
            of Chaos which fought during the Heresy, which also included the
            myriad Daemons of the Warp, Human Traitors from the Imperial Army,
            the potent infantry and combat walker forces of the Dark Mechanicum
            and Chaos Cultists drawn from across the galaxy.
          </p>
          <p>
            The flesh and power armour of Chaos Space Marines often warps and
            twists into new, darker and inhuman forms under the influence of the
            Warp energies they are exposed to as their shapes morph to embody
            the corrupted Astartes' new allegiance.
          </p>
          <p>
            Chaos Space Marines fight for everything they were once forbidden to
            indulge in as the ascetic servants of the Emperor and the selfless
            guardians of Mankind. Pleasure, wealth, mayhem, but above all else,
            the power to rule their fellow Humans in the name of the Chaos Gods
            is the driving ambition and goal of every Chaos Space Marine.
          </p>
          <p>
            All Heretic Astartes are ultimately united by this sheer hunger for
            power. At first, this desire is focused towards specific goals, but
            as time passes, it becomes a bone-deep obsession. Though the Dark
            Gods are given to rewarding their mortal followers for acts of
            carnage that further their divine cause, the gifts they bestow upon
            their favoured are fickle indeed.
          </p>
          <p>
            A particularly extravagant slaughter might be rewarded with a
            blood-red aura that invigorates the supplicant, but it is just as
            likely the champion will find his arms being reshaped as axes of
            bone, or that he has the face of a slavering hound.
          </p>
          <p>
            Eventually, the Chaos Space Marine seeks immortality, to ascend to
            such lofty heights of favour that he is remade as a Daemon Prince.
            But for every successful aspirant there are hundreds of failures,
            mutated beyond recognition into mewling abominations called Chaos
            Spawn.
