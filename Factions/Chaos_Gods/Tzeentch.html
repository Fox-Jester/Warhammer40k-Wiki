          <p>
            Tzeentch is the Chaos God of change, evolution, mutation, intrigue,
            ambition, knowledge, sorcery, destiny, lies and trickery. Tzeentch
            is especially empowered by the desire for change and ambition for
            advancement among mortals.
          </p>
          <p>
            Tzeentch's true power is sorcery, and as all sorcery flows from the
            font of the Immaterium, so too is Tzeentch the master of that
            twisted, chaotic medium of psychic energy. Tzeentch embodies
            mortals' tendency towards mutability and change, the drive to evolve
            and manipulate. This spirit is present in the essence of every
            living creature from the first division of cells in the womb to the
            ultimate craving for survival.
          </p>
          <p>
            It is in the hearts of those with the strongest desire to prevail
            that Tzeentch whispers his insidious promise; offering a means of
            life eternal to those unwilling to accept death and oblivion as
            inevitable.
          </p>
          <p>
            It is also Tzeentch who weaves the threads that connect every
            action, plot and subtle intrigue in a galaxy-wide game of
            manipulation and subterfuge. At the end of each of these threads
            lies the ensnared soul of a Human puppet; those of Tzeentch's mortal
            servants and agents who believe they serve the Lord of Sorcery in
            mutually beneficial pacts.
          </p>
          <p>
            The truth is that Tzeentch's every action is planned with its
            ultimate goal as his own establishment as the pre-eminent Chaos
            power in the Realm of Chaos, the ultimate victor in the Great Game.
            Of course, the very nature of the Lord of Entropy is such that, were
            he to attain this triumph, he would still strive for turmoil and
            change. In many ways, Tzeentch is both the best and least understood
            of the Dark Gods.
          </p>
          <p>
            He is the god of fate, plots, and schemes, as well as the god that
            exemplifies the ever-changing nature of the Warp. However, Tzeentch
            does not plot towards some end (at least none that can be
            comprehended); he schemes simply to scheme. He is constantly
            building, even as his devices unravel under their own complexity. At
            the same time, he is the god of knowledge and comprehension, and his
            devotees may be those who seek a deeper understanding of an often
            enigmatic universe.
          </p>
          <p>
            Tzeentch is known by a hundred thousand titles across the galaxy,
            amongst them the "Weaver of Destinies," the "Great Conspirator," and
            the "Architect of Fate." In his mind, he listens to the hopes and
            desires for change of every sentient being from every planet in the
            universe. He watches over the plans of his playthings as they unfold
            into history, toying with fate and fortune; both for his own
            entertainment and to further his unfathomable schemes.
          </p>
          <p>
            Tzeentch feeds upon and is empowered by the mortal emotions of need
            and desire for change that is an essential part of all life in the
            universe. All people dream of prosperity, freedom from injustice and
            a better tomorrow. These dreams are not just the preserve of the
            impoverished or the powerless -- even Imperial planetary governors
            and Imperial Navy battlefleet admirals dream of further riches, or
            perhaps even an end to their responsibilities to the Emperor.
          </p>
          <p>
            All these dreams and desires create a powerful impetus for change,
            and the ambitions of nations create a force that can challenge
            history. Tzeentch is the embodiment of that force within the
            Immaterium. He was the second of the Chaos Gods to come to full
            sentience within the Warp, sometime during Old Earth's European
            medieval period in the 2nd Millennium. His birth marked the
            maturation of Human nations and politics, with all of their implicit
            intrigues and double-dealings.
          </p>
          <p>
            Tzeentch is not content to merely observe the fulfillment and
            disappointment brought by the passage of time. He has his own plans
            -- schemes that are so complex and closely woven that they touch the
            lives of every living thing, whether they realise it or not. The
            Chaos God's masterly comprehension of time, history and intrigue
            allows his ploys to intertwine seamlessly, forming a web of
            causality that spans the stars.
          </p>
          <p>
            Tzeentch is aware of the visions and plans of all mortals in the
            galaxy. He takes great delight in the plotting and politicking of
            others and favours the cunning over the strong. When the inner voice
            in a person's head speaks, when the desperate whisper their prayers
            into the night, it is the Architect of Fate that listens.
          </p>
          <p>
            He perceives every event and intention, and from this information,
            his mighty mind can work out how each will influence the future. The
            intertwining latticework of probability, hope and change is
            Tzeentch's meat and drink -- without it he would eventually fade
            away.
          </p>
          <p>
            Perhaps the Architect of Fate has plans to overthrow the other Chaos
            Gods, or to extend his dominion over all the mortal realms. Perhaps
            not even Tzeentch himself can say for sure. Whatever his ultimate
            goal, he seeks to achieve it by manipulating the individual lives of
            Humans and xenos alike.
          </p>
          <p>
            By offering the power of knowledge and sorcery, he can recruit
            influential Chaos warlords and magi to his cause, affecting the
            lives of many more at a single stroke. However, few of Tzeentch's
            plans are ever simple; some span aeons with their complexity, whilst
            many appear contradictory to others, or even against his own
            interests. Only Tzeentch can see the threads of potential futures
            weaving through time like tangled skeins of multicoloured cords;
            cords which themselves are made of decision, happenstance and fluke.
          </p>
          <p>
            Tzeentch is the undisputed master of sorcery in the universe.
            Sorcery is one of the most potent agents of change, and those who
            use it are amongst the most ambitious and hungry for power. The raw
            psychic energy that empowers the psykers of the mortal realm is the
            actual fabric of the Realm of Chaos, the same fabric that makes up
            the Ruinous Powers, their Daemon servants and the shadow-selves of
            mortal consciousness that flicker in the Warp and that Humanity
            calls souls.
          </p>
          <p>
            The use of psychic power, or "magic" as it can rightly be called, is
            held as the ultimate expression of faith among Tzeentch's followers,
            who have much to gain from his patronage. Though it will likely cost
            them their immortal souls, they will at least have boundless power
            to show for it while they live; this is in stark contrast to the
            poor wretched psykers of the Imperium of Man, who are corralled by
            the Inquisition's Black Ships and brought to Terra where many of
            them feed the dying Emperor's boundless hunger for psychic energy to
            power the Astronomican.
          </p>
          <p>
            In Tzeentch's eyes, mortal creatures are immeasurably steeped in
            ambiguity, yet they somehow wage their personal wars completely
            unaware of the countless contradictions in their souls. Tzeentch
            cannot help but dabble in the mortal realm; some amongst the
            Inquisition believe that the Great Conspirator is responsible for
            the exponential increases of psychic ability in the Human species in
            recent millennia.
          </p>
          <p>
            His own need to manipulate and control, and his desire to increase
            his own power in the Warp, mean Tzeentch is eternally playing the
            Great Game waged amongst his brother Chaos Gods. The Architect of
            Fate is not above sullying his clawed hands with the bloody business
            of war, though he much prefers to win his battles through guile and
            sorcery than brute force. Consumed by his own ineffable thoughts,
            Tzeentch binds the galaxy in the weave of his complex schemes just
            as a spider binds a fly.
          </p>
          <p>
            Though his schemes can take Terran millennia to unfold, when they
            come to fruition, it is usually reality itself that pays the price.
            While one mortal lies to another, while envy and ambition survive
            among Humans and aliens, Tzeentch will work his magic as the puppet
            master of the universe, working towards the day when his final great
            work will be revealed.
          </p>
          <p>
            Tzeentch exerts his influence in the mortal realm through subtle
            manipulation and devious ploys. The victims of his corruption are
            sorcerers drawn by the promise of forbidden knowledge; scholars who
            seek knowledge at all costs; politicians lured by the power
            knowledge provides to outmanoeuvre their opponents.
          </p>
          <p>
            Tzeentch's sacred number is nine, his colours are typically seen as
            blue and gold but an ever-changing rainbow of colour is appropriate
            as well, thus giving the name to the Lord of Change's Daemonic
            armies, the Scintillating Legions.
