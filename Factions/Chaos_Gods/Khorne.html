          <p>
            Khorne is the Chaos God of war, hatred, rage, wrath, blood, martial
            honour, strength and murder. Its portfolio of interest covers the
            most basic and brutal of sentient emotions and actions, such as
            hate, anger, rage, the desire for destruction and the joy of killing
            one's enemies.
          </p>
          <p>
            Every act of killing or murder in the material universe feeds and
            empowers Khorne; the more senseless and destructive, the better.
            However, though Khorne is the god of bloody slaughter, it is also
            the god of martial pride and honour, of those who set themselves
            against the most dangerous foes and earn victory against the odds.
          </p>
          <p>
            A devotee of Khorne is as likely to be an honourable champion in
            combat as a blood-crazed slaughterer. Khornates take no artful
            approach to killing, seeking only to slay rather than to inflict
            pain, because while the blood and death of their victims strengthens
            Khorne, their suffering actually empowers its nemesis Slaanesh.
          </p>
          <p>
            The name "Khorne" derives from the god's name in Chaos' Daemonic
            Dark Tongue, Kharneth, meaning "Lord of Rage" or "Lord of Blood."
            Khorne is the mightiest and the oldest of the four major Chaos Gods,
            fully coming into existence in the Immaterium sometime during
            Terra's European Middle Ages in the early 2nd Millennium, its birth
            heralded by an era of wars and conflict that raged across the globe.
          </p>
          <p>
            Khorne is the Blood God, Lord of Rage, Taker of Skulls. It is wrath
            incarnate, the embodiment of a never-ending lust to dominate and
            destroy. It is Khorne's sole desire to drown the galaxy in a tide of
            slaughter, to conquer and kill every living thing until there is
            nothing left but spilt blood and shattered bone.
          </p>
          <p>
            The code of Khorne is simple: blood and more blood. Its only temple
            is the battlefield, its sole sacrament the spilled blood of nations.
            Consciously or not, all warrior cultures pay Khorne homage with
            their acts of murder and destruction, from the headhunting tribes of
            backwater Feral Worlds to the planet-conquering Chaos Space Marine
            warbands of the World Eaters Traitor Legion.
          </p>
          <p>
            Every single life taken in anger increases the Blood God's power. It
            looks well upon those warriors who slay their friends and allies,
            for they prove their understanding of a greater truth -- Khorne
            cares not from whence the blood flows, only that it flows. Friends
            or enemies, all the dead are equal in the eyes of the Lord of
            Battle. Those Khornate devotees who let a day pass without
            committing an act of bloody-handed slaughter inevitably incur the
            Blood God's displeasure.
          </p>
          <p>
            Khorne is said to have inherited a martial nobility and honour, and
            considers the weak and helpless to be unworthy of its wrath. The
            battle-cry of the followers of Khorne reflects the god's desire for
            wanton violence: "Blood for the Blood God! Skulls for the Throne of
            Khorne!" Alternatively, they may cry, "Skulls for the Skull Throne!"
          </p>
          <p>
            In the throes of violence, Khorne's followers are also known to
            bellow, "KILL! MAIM! BURN!" repeatedly while hacking apart their
            enemies. Also, the Khornate Berserkers known as Khorne's Chosen
            often shout "Break their backs!" while in the thick of the brutal,
            bloody battle they so passionately seek out.
          </p>
          <p>
            Followers of the Chaos God Slaanesh, who Khornates see as degenerate
            scum who kill only for pleasure rather than to test one's self
            against mighty enemies, are favoured foes to face in battle, as are
            the servants of Tzeentch, who are seen as sorcerers unwilling to
            engage in fair and honourable combat.
          </p>
          <p>
            Khorne's sacred number is eight, reflected in the organisation of
            the god's Daemonic armies, the Blood Legions, and in smaller matters
            such as the number of syllables in a Khornate Daemon's name. Where
            possible, the Blood God's warriors will form up into squads of this
            number.
          </p>
          <p>
            Khorne's primary colours are blood red, black and brass. Also note
            that the Mark of Khorne looks vaguely like a figure of eight or a
            stylised Human skull.
