            Slaanesh is the Chaos God of pleasure, pain, hedonism, excess,
            perfection and decadence. Lust, pride and self-indulgence are the
            hallmarks of all who follow it.
          </p>
          <p>
            Slaanesh is the youngest of the four major Chaos Gods, having come
            to full self-awareness within the Immaterium only during the 30th
            Millennium. The name Slaanesh is a corruption of the Aeldari term
            Slaaneth (Slaa meaning "ecstasy" or "pleasure" and Neth meaning
            "lord" or "prince" in the Aeldari Lexicon; hence, the "Prince of
            Pleasure"), though ironically, the Aeldari refer to this foul entity
            only as Sai'lanthresh, "She Who Thirsts."
          </p>
          <p>
            Slaanesh is the Prince of Pleasure, the Dark God dedicated to the
            pursuit of earthly gratification and the overthrow of all decent
            behaviour, as well as hedonism and pleasure for its own sake. It is
            the god of obsession, the Master of Excess in All Things, from
            gluttony to lust to megalomania. Its sacred number is six and the
            colours associated with Slaanesh are riotous purples, pinks and
            black. The Daemonic armies of Slaanesh are known as the Legions of
            Excess.
          </p>
          <p>
            Wherever mortals are ruled by their own unquenchable desires, the
            Dark Prince of Chaos is there in the shadows, whispering, tempting,
            and feasting on a banquet of souls. But this is true in all things,
            not just carnal pleasures. Those who desire to indulge in the finest
            culinary delights, the most beautiful artworks, even the most
            sensual clothing, could all be amongst Slaanesh's disciples. Just as
            importantly, Slaanesh is also the god of perfection. The singer
            striving for the most beautiful song or the warrior who seeks the
            perfect fighting techniques, both could be devotees of Slaanesh.
          </p>
          <p>
            Slaanesh was given life by the immorality and hubris of the ancient
            Aeldari Empire. As their empire reached its zenith, the Aeldari
            became lost in their own decadence, for they experience sensation
            and emotion to a far greater degree than any other intelligent
            species of the galaxy. The capabilities of their highly advanced
            technology meant that the Aeldari did not need to labour or wage
            war. Instead, they were able to dedicate their lives to whatever
            idle pursuits took their fancy. Over several generations, this
            indolence and hedonism came to rule and pervert their souls.
          </p>
          <p>
            In the Immaterium, the collective psychic reflections of their
            indolence and amoral hedonism caused a new major Chaos power to
            stir, beginning in the 25th Millennium of the Terran calendar.
            Created by one species' pure dedication to indulgence and excess,
            the first psychic motes of what would become Slaanesh began to
            coalesce. The dormant Slaanesh fed upon the unchecked collective
            psyche of the Aeldari, drawing on their lusts and ambitions, their
            artistry and pursuit of excellence in all things. In turn, as
            Slaanesh grew, its nascent dreams trickled into the minds of the
            Aeldari and fuelled their desires, pushing them ever onwards towards
            their eventual doom.
          </p>
          <p>
            Eventually, the Aeldari civilisation devolved into little more than
            pleasure cults dedicated to every act of physical, mental and
            spiritual fulfillment. Blood stained the statuary of their plazas as
            crowds of drug-addled maniacs sated their violent desires in the
            streets of the Aeldari homeworlds. On one particularly depraved
            night, the debauchery reached a terrible crescendo that tore out the
            heart of the Aeldari Empire and left it ravaged beyond recovery.
          </p>
          <p>
            The Fall of the Aeldari in the early 30th Millennium was signalled
            by the birth-scream of Slaanesh, a tsunami of emotion and psychic
            power that heralded the Prince of Pleasure's arrival in the Realm of
            Chaos even as it shaped a new dominion within that dimension to
            serve as its home, the Dark Prince's Realm. The psychic implosion
            caused by Slaanesh's birth swallowed hundreds of worlds at the heart
            of the Aeldari Empire in what is now the Imperium of Man's Segmentum
            Obscurus.
          </p>
          <p>
            The blast killed billions of Aeldari in a single instant and
            devoured a great section of the galaxy in the process. Such was its
            ferocity that it overwhelmed the barrier between the material and
            the immaterial, forming the massive, permanent Warp rift later named
            by Humanity as the "Eye of Terror." Rampant and hungry, Slaanesh
            devoured the minds and souls of the Aeldari, absorbing them into its
            essence. Across the galaxy, that ancient species was almost wiped
            out.
          </p>
          <p>
            After its birth, Slaanesh slew most of the Aeldari and their gods in
            the Immaterium, except for the Aeldari god of war Kaela Mensha
            Khaine. Khaine's psychic energy was instead dispersed into many
            separate pieces scattered across the various Infinity Circuits of
            the Aeldari craftworlds. The Laughing God Cegorach also survived
            Slaanesh's birth by fleeing into the Labyrinth Dimension of the
            Webway. While Isha, the goddess of fertility and the harvest, was
            defeated alongside her divine brethren, she was not destroyed
            outright and absorbed by Slaanesh like the rest of the Aeldari
            pantheon. Slaanesh vanquished her as it had all of the other Aeldari
            gods within the Warp, but only took her prisoner rather than
            absorbing her energies outright.
          </p>
          <p>
            What fell purpose Slaanesh had in keeping Isha alive, none amongst
            the Aeldari now know, but the Prince of Pleasure was ultimately
            denied its spoils: for some reason Nurgle, the Plague Lord, waged
            war against Slaanesh to "rescue" the Aeldari goddess. Why
            Grandfather Nurgle intervened is unclear, although some Aeldari
            savants believe that one of the older major Chaos Gods wanted to
            give the youngest amongst them a good lesson about its proper place
            in the order of things. What is known is that Nurgle's Daemonic
            legions proved victorious and the Plague God took the Aeldari
            goddess back to its domain in the Realm of Chaos.
          </p>
          <p>
            Only a relative few Aeldari survived Slaanesh's birth-feast. Other
            Aeldari survivors included the Harlequin, and those Craftworld
            Aeldari or "Asuryani" who were very far away from the Aeldari
            homeworlds when the Warp rift formed. Most of the survivors that
            remain have become sworn enemies of the Dark Prince, and yet a few
            of them -- the Drukhari -- have formed isolated cabals that still
            behave as their ancestors did, perversely following the downward
            spiral of excess and hedonism.
          </p>
          <p>
            That is how events are viewed from the chronology of the material
            universe. In the Warp, however, things are different, for the
            Immaterium is not bound by linear four-dimensional time, and events
            do not occur in a strict sequence of cause and effect. As its rival
            gods reckon it, Slaanesh has always existed in the Warp, and yet has
            never existed at all.
          </p>
          <p>
            Some say that it is impossible for mortals to look upon the divine
            face of Slaanesh without losing their soul to it, for all who see
            its face become willing slaves to the whims of the Dark Prince,
            embracing its ways with wild abandon. The mere knowledge of
            Slaanesh's existence can cause a world to topple into corruption and
            hidden depravity.
          </p>
          <p>
            Not even the agents of the Inquisition know for sure how far
            Slaanesh's influence spreads, for wherever the lust for the
            pleasures of power and temporal gain exists, the talons of Slaanesh
            dig deep. Despite their best efforts, it is almost certain that the
            Imperium is rotten to the core, just as the Aeldari Empire was
            before it. How long before it succumbs to a similar fate?
