            Nurgle is the Chaos God of disease, decay, despair, destruction,
            death and rebirth. In particular, the emotion of despair in mortals
            empowers the Plague God more than any other.
          </p>
          <p>
            Nurgle was the third of the Chaos Gods to fully awaken within the
            Warp, emerging during the 2nd Millennium in the midst of Old Earth's
            European Middle Ages, as great plagues swept across the world
            heralding the god's birth.
          </p>
          <p>
            Nurgle is the Chaos God most directly involved with the plight of
            mortals, particularly Humans who suffer so acutely from a fear of
            death, perhaps the oldest fear of that species, or any other. While
            Nurgle is the god of death and decay, it is also the god of rebirth.
            Decay is simply one part of the cycle of life, without which no new
            life could grow. In the same way, Nurgle is also the god of
            perseverance and survival. While those who wish to spread decay and
            corruption are certainly amongst its followers, there are also those
            who wish to endure, to become resilient enough to handle the
            difficulties and opportunities presented by an uncaring universe.
            Many of those affected by Nurgle's poxes usually turn to the god in
            order to escape the pain and sheer despair caused by sickness and
            disease.
          </p>
          <p>
            Nurgle is the Great Lord of Decay and the Master of Plague and
            Pestilence. All things, no matter how solid and permanent they seem,
            are liable to eventual corruption and death. Even the process of
            creation is but the precursor to destruction and decay. The bastion
            of today is tomorrow's ruin, the maiden of the morning is the crone
            of the night, and the hope of a moment is but the foundation of
            regret.
          </p>
          <p>
            Though Nurgle is the ultimate creator of every infection and
            epidemic to have ever swept the universe, Nurgle is not a morose
            purveyor of despair and gloom, but in fact a vibrant god of life and
            laughter. In death, there is life. Upon the decay of the living
            untold numbers of bacteria, viruses, insects and other
            carrion-feeders thrive. All life feeds upon other life to exist, and
            from every plague grows new generations, stronger and more virile
            than those who came before. Regeneration comes from decay, just as
            hope springs from despair. The greatest inspiration comes in the
            darkest moments; in times of crisis mortals are truly tested and
            driven to excel.
          </p>
          <p>
            To understand what might otherwise seem contradictory or even
            perverse in nature, one must first comprehend that which Nurgle
            embodies. On the one hand, he is the Lord of Decay, whose body is
            wracked with disease; on the other, the god is full of unexpected
            energy and a desire to organise and enlighten.
          </p>
          <p>
            The citizens of the Imperium know full well that their lives will
            end one day and that many of their number will live with disease or
            other torments in the meantime, yet they drive this knowledge deep
            into the corners of their minds and bury it with dreams and
            ceaseless activity. Nurgle is the embodiment of that knowledge of
            mortality and the unconscious response of all sentient beings to the
            knowledge of their own ending. It is the hidden fear of disease and
            decay, the gnawing truth of mortality and the power of defiance that
            it generates.
          </p>
          <p>
            Every single Human being in the galaxy has been touched by Nurgle's
            foetid hand at some point. Countless trillions are host to its
            malignant, invisible creations, which corrupt their physical forms
            and sow despair in their minds. Interplanetary traffic ensures that
            contagious diseases are carried from world to world by the ignorant,
            the wilful and the strong.
          </p>
          <p>
            As Nurgle's gifts multiply in full-blown pandemics, his power
            reaches a peak. Whole star systems -- even whole sectors -- are
            quarantined as plague runs rife across the stars. Proud
            civilisations wither away even as Grandfather Nurgle conjures
            obscene new life from their remains. Wherever there are plague pits
            and mass graves, the rotting splendour of Nurgle shines through.
          </p>
          <p>
            Despite his consistent "generosity," only an enlightened few truly
            embrace Nurgle's greatness among Humans and aliens. Yet the god's
            worshippers exist in numbers enough to ensure his Daemon servants
            access to the material dimension wherever plague abounds. This is
            just as well, for of all the Chaos Gods, it is Nurgle who most
            appreciates the personal touch.
          </p>
          <p>
            Nurgle's sacred number is seven, his colours are those of rot and
            ruin, waste and vomit, mucus and pus. The Plague God is represented
            by the colours of green and brown, generally the most putrid
            variations of each. Nurgle also embodies the will of Mankind and
            other intelligent species to struggle on no matter what opposes it,
            albeit perversely. Suffering, death, pain: Human beings push these
            things from their minds and try to forget them by living in the
            moment in the hope that the future will be a better one.
          </p>
          <p>
            For this reason, Nurgle, his Daemonic Plague Legions and mortal
            followers usually demonstrate a disturbing joy at the pestilence
            that their god inflicts, seeing the plagues as gifts and the cries
            of their victims as gratitude for the strength to overcome the
            obstacles of a mortal life rather than agony. The Plague Lord is
            often referred to as "Grandfather Nurgle," "Father Nurgle" or "Papa
            Nurgle" by his followers because of this hideous paternal stance.
          </p>
          <p>
            It has recently been uncovered by the Aeldari Harlequins that Nurgle
            is in possession of the Aeldari goddess Isha (whom he rescued from
            Slaanesh's clutches), and imprisoned her within his realm in the
            Warp. Nurgle utilises her for his experiments, creating new
            contagions and diseases to spread into the material universe.
          </p>
          <p>
            With her divine powers of healing, Isha quickly regenerates from
            these tests, although Nurgle gleans what information is desired from
            the temporary effects. It is said that, secretly, she whispers the
            cures to those diseases to the mortals of the universe.
