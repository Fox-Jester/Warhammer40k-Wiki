          <h2>Xenos</h2>

          <p>
            Xenos (pronounced ZEE-nahs or zehn-AHS) is a High Gothic term used
            by the people and adepta of the Imperium of Man that means
            "stranger" and "alien." It is often used by the Adeptus Terra to
            signify intelligent enemy aliens or off-world, non-Human forces.
          </p>
          <p>
            The main starfaring, intelligent xenos species in the Milky Way
            Galaxy are the Drukhari, Craftworld Aeldari, Necrons, Orks, T'au and
            Tyranids, though there are countless other intelligent alien
            species, most of them hostile, that Mankind has encountered over the
            long millennia of its expansion across the stars.

          <div class="info-card">
            <h3>Tyranids</h3>
            <img src="../images/tyranid-card-img.jpg" />
          </div>
          <p>
            The Tyranids are an extragalactic composite species of hideous,
            insectoid xenos. They actually comprise an entire space-faring
            ecosystem comprised of innumerable different bioforms which are all
            variations on the same genetic theme.
          </p>
          <p>
            The Tyranids are unlike any other intelligent species encountered by
            Humanity. They are the ultimate predators; to them, all living
            things, from the lowliest insect to the most advanced starfaring
            civilisation, are mere prey. Only now are the inhabitants of the
            galaxy realising the scale of the threat; unless the Tyranids can be
            stopped, it will mean nothing less than the extinction of all life.
          </p>
          <p>
            The Tyranid species is ultimately dedicated solely to its own
            survival, propagation and evolutionary advancement. The Tyranids
            collectively form a monstrous superorganism that travels across the
            universe in their great hive fleets of biomechanical Hive Ships,
            systematically consuming all other biomatter to enable their own
            rapid evolution and reproduction.
          </p>
          <p>
            The Tyranids are likened to a galactic swarm consuming everything in
            its path, feeding on entire worlds and leaving only dead husks in
            their wake. Their threat is such that an unprotected planet can be
            infested and stripped clean of all its organic material in a matter
            of solar weeks without even slowing down the advance of the hive
            fleet.
          </p>
          <p>
            All Tyranid organisms are "synaptic" (psychically-reactive), and
            each Tyranid creature within a hive fleet shares and contributes to
            a communal Hive Mind, which allows the trillions of beings
            comprising the Tyranid hive fleets to communicate and organise
            instantaneously on a staggering scale.
          </p>
          <p>
            The mentality of the Tyranid approach to warfare can be described
            with the phrase "quantity has a quality all its own." From the
            "lowly" Ripper, to the deadly Hive Tyrant and beyond, the signature
            of the Tyranid species is that they overwhelm their foes with sheer
            numbers, reproducing massive numbers of highly virulent organisms in
            record time from the biochemical soup that they derive from the
            biospheres of the worlds they consume.
          </p>
          <p>
            The components of a Tyranid hive fleet travel almost exclusively in
            large groups known as "swarms" that possess specialised
            biomechanical creatures for destroying and consuming a wide variety
            of prey life forms.
          </p>
          <p>
            The Tyranids have evolved sophisticated methods for facilitating
            genetic transfer across species boundaries. As a result, a
            significant goal of any Tyranid invasion is acquisition of useful
            new biological traits from other lifeforms.
          </p>
          <p>
            These are used by the Hive Mind to enhance the Tyranids'
            effectiveness in consuming new worlds to gain more of the necessary
            organic raw materials for further reproduction and directed
            evolution. All Tyranids are reproduced by a single, highly
            intelligent female bioform known as a Norn-Queen.
          </p>
          <p>
            A hive fleet's Norn-Queens are the most important Tyranids within
            the fleet, for if they are injured or killed the Tyranids cannot
            reproduce their numbers from the captured bio-mass. As a result,
            Norn-Queens can be found only at the heart of the largest and
            most-well defended Tyranid Hive Ships.

          <div class="info-card">
            <h3>Necrons</h3>
            <img src="../images/Necrons-card-img.jpg" alt="" />
          </div>
          <p>
            The Necrons are a mysterious xenos species of humanoid, robotic
            skeletal warriors that have lain dormant in their stasis-tombs for
            more than 60 million Terran years, though they have begun to awaken
            at last. They are the soulless creations, former servants and now
            the captors of the ancient C'tan, the terrible Star Gods of Aeldari
            myth.
          </p>
          <p>
            The Necrons are ancient beyond reckoning, predating even the birth
            of the Aeldari. At long last, however, they are beginning to awaken
            from their Tomb Worlds, for the galaxy is ripe for conquest and the
            restoration of the Necron Empire since the disappearance of the Old
            Ones more than 60 million standard years ago.
          </p>
          <p>
            The Necrons are a completely robotic humanoid species whose
            technological prowess is probably unmatched by any of the other
            intelligent species of the galaxy. Yet out of a desire for vengeance
            against the more fortunate, long-lived, ancient xenos people called
            the Old Ones, and the trickery of the godlike intelligences known as
            the C'tan, the Necrons shed their original organic forms and lost
            all forms of compassion and empathy.
          </p>
          <p>
            They have become instead ruthless, undying killing machines who are
            determined to exert their mastery over the galaxy once more. Across
            the galaxy, this ancient and terrible species is stirring back to
            life. Entombed in stasis-crypts for millions of Terran years, they
            have slumbered through the aeons, waiting for the galaxy to heal
            from the wounds of a long and bloody war.
          </p>
          <p>
            Now, after sixty million standard years of dormancy, a great purpose
            begins. On desolate worlds thought long-bereft of all life, ancient
            machineries wake into grim purpose, commencing the slow process of
            revivification that will see those entombed within freed to stride
            across the stars once again. The unstoppable, undying Necron legions
            are rising. Let the galaxy beware.
          </p>
          <p>
            All Necrons, from the lowliest of warriors to the most regal of
            lords, are driven by one ultimate goal, to restore their ancient
            ruling dynasties to glory and to bring the galaxy under their rule
            once more, as it was in ancient days.
          </p>
          <p>
            Such was the edict long ago encoded into the Necrons' minds, and it
            is a command so fundamental to their being that it cannot be denied.
            Yet it is no small task, for the Necrons are awakening from their
            Tomb Worlds to find the galaxy of the 41st Millennium as recorded by
            the Imperial Calendar much changed.
          </p>
          <p>
            Many Tomb Worlds are no more, destroyed by cosmic disaster or alien
            invasion. Others are damaged, their entombed legions afflicted by
            slow madness or worn to dust by entropy's irresistible onset.
          </p>
          <p>
            Degenerate alien species squat amongst the ruins of those Necron
            Tomb Worlds that remain, little aware of the greatness they defile
            with their upstart presence. Yet there is no salvation to be found
            in such ignorance. The undying have come to reclaim their lands, and
            the living shall be swept aside.
          </p>
          <p>
            Yet if billions of Necrons have been destroyed by the passage of
            eternity, countless billions more remain to see their dominion
            reborn. They are not creatures of flesh and blood, these Necrons,
            but android warriors whose immortal forms are forged from living
            metal. As such, they are almost impervious to destruction, and their
            mechanical bodies are swift to heal even the gravest wounds.
          </p>
          <p>
            Given time, severed limbs reattach, armour plating reknits and
            shattered mechanical organs are rebuilt. The only way, then, to
            assure a Necron's destruction is to overwhelm its ability to
            self-repair, to inflict such massive damage that its ancient
            regenerative systems cannot keep pace.
          </p>
          <p>
            Even then, should irreparable damage occur, the Necron will often
            simply "phase out" -- an automated viridian teleportation beam
            returning it to the safety of the stasis-crypts, where it remains in
            storage until such time as repairs can be carried out.
          </p>
          <p>
            The sciences by which such feats are achieved remain a mystery to
            outsiders, for the Necrons do not share their secrets with lesser
            species and have set contingencies to prevent their supreme
            technologies from falling into the wrong hands. Should a fallen
            Necron warrior fail to phase out, it self-destructs and is consumed
            in a blaze of emerald light.
          </p>
          <p>
            Outwardly, this appears little different to the glow of
            teleportation, leaving the foe to wonder whether the Necron has
            finally been destroyed or has merely retreated to its tomb. Victory
            over the Necrons is therefore always a tenuous thing, and a hard-won
            battle grants little surety of ultimate victory.
          </p>
          <p>
            For the Necrons, defeats are minor inconveniences -- the preludes to
            future triumphs, nothing more. Immortality has brought patience; the
            perils that the Necrons survived in ancient times carry the lesson
            their people can overcome any opposition, if they have but the will
            to try. And if the Necrons possess only a single trait, it is a will
            as unbending as adamantium.
          </p>
          <p>
            Only one hope can now preserve the other intelligent species of the
            galaxy from the Necrons' advance, from the endless legions of silent
            and deathless warriors rising from long-forgotten tombs. If the
            Necrons can be prevented from waking to their full glory, if the
            scattered Tomb Worlds can be prevented from unifying, then there is
            a chance of survival.
          </p>
          <p>
            If not, then the great powers of the galaxy will surely fall, and
            the Necrons shall rule supreme for all eternity -- undying, cruel
            and utterly implacable.

          <h2 id="Orks-header">Orks</h2>
          <div class="info-card">
            <h3>Orks</h3>
            <img src="../images/Orks-card-img.jpg" alt="" />
          </div>
          <p>
            The Orks, also called Greenskins, are a savage, warlike,
            green-skinned species of bestial, asexual humanoids who are spread
            all across the galaxy. They are unique among the intelligent xenos
            species known to Mankind in that they possess the physiological
            features of both animals and fungi. They share many physical and
            cultural features with the dark fantasy Warhammer universe's Orcs
            (and were initially called "Space Orcs" to distinguish them).
          </p>
          <p>
            Orks are seen by their enemies (pretty much everyone else in the
            universe) as primitive, barbaric, hyper-violent, and crude, but they
            are the most successful and widepsread intelligent species in the
            whole galaxy, outnumbering possibly every other intelligent
            starfaring species, even Humanity (with the very plausible exception
            of the Tyranids).
          </p>
          <p>
            Greenskins are one of the most dangerous alien races to plague the
            galaxy. Numerous beyond belief and driven always to fight and
            conquer, the Orks threaten every single intelligent species of the
            galaxy.
          </p>
          <p>
            Orks are possibly the most warlike aliens in the 41st Millennium,
            and their number is beyond counting. Amid constant, seething tides
            of battle and bloodshed, burgeoning Ork stellar empires rise and
            fall.
          </p>
          <p>
            Mercifully most are short-lived, soon destroying themselves in a
            maelstrom of violence and internecine conflict, but should the Orks
            ever truly unify, they would crush all opposition.
          </p>
          <p>
            Orks generate a potent psychic gestalt field that allows them to
            accomplish many feats of technological engineering that might
            otherwise seem impossible. At the same time, the power of this
            psychic field is directly proportional to the number of Greenskins
            present in a given location.
          </p>
          <p>
            The more Orks that gather, the more Orks are drawn to them, at the
            same time that the power and intelligence of the Greenskins begins
            to grow with their numbers.
          </p>
          <p>
            The Orks' unquenchable thirst for battle has always proved their
            downfall: historically, the Ork tribes have spent much of their time
            fighting amongst themselves, waging brutal wars with only the
            strongest surviving. On occasion, an Ork leader will emerge who is
            mighty enough to defeat his rivals and unite the warring tribes.
          </p>
          <p>
            His success draws other tribes to him, and soon a great WAAAGH! is
            underway -- partly a migration, partly a holy war that can
            exterminate the populations of entire star systems.
          </p>
          <p>
            When the Orks are on the rampage, the galaxy trembles, and in the
            Age of the Dark Imperium there are more WAAAGH!s rising than ever
            before recorded.
