            The Death Guard are one of the Traitor Legions of Chaos Space
            Marines. They worship and devote themselves exclusively to the Chaos
            God Nurgle and as a result of his mutational "gifts" they have
            become Plague Marines; Heretic Astartes who are eternally rotting
            away within their power armour and infected with every known form of
            disease and decay but who are immune to all pain or minor injury.
          </p>
          <p>
            When the XIVth Legion was first raised on Terra by the Emperor
            during the First Founding, its Astartes were known as the Dusk
            Raiders. After the XIVth Legion was reunited with its Primarch
            Mortarion on the world of Barbarus, he renamed the Legion the Death
            Guard.
          </p>
          <p>
            The Death Guard are a Traitor Legion entirely steeped in the power
            of Nurgle, the Chaos God of death, disease and despair, their very
            essence the epitome of all that vile Chaos God stands for. Their
            bodies are hives of filth and decay, their ﬂesh eternally rotting
            away even as it is renewed by the ceaseless process of death and
            rebirth.
          </p>
          <p>
            Once, however, the Death Guard were the strongest and most resilient
            of all of the Emperor's Space Marine Legions, the inheritors of
            Primarch Mortarion in whose genetic image they were created.
            Mortarion grew to maturity on the world of Barbarus, a planet
            steeped in a toxic miasma where the Human population cowered in the
            dark lowlands, fearful of the overlords that preyed upon them from
            their mountaintop keeps deep within the fog.
          </p>
          <p>
            History does not record who or what these beings truly were, but it
            is certain they were more than, or at least other than, Human. For
            one, they were able to breathe the deadly gases that made up the
            atmosphere of Barbarus, getting ever more deadly the higher the
            altitude, but they are said to have displayed other abilities too.
            The abominable masters of Barbarus were somehow able to enslave or
            dominate the ﬂesh of the dead, and they preyed upon the cringing
            natives in the valleys below, ever needful of raw material to fuel
            the endless wars they fought against one another.
          </p>
          <p>
            The infant primarch was raised by one such overlord, Necare, the
            greatest of them all, who taught him the ways of war, yet would not
            answer his questions regarding the people who dwelled in the
            lowlands. When Mortarion defied his master and descended through the
            fog, which as a superhuman primarch he could breathe, he found
            people, like himself, if weaker and existing in perpetual terror of
            the overlords who preyed upon them each night.
          </p>
          <p>
            Though they were initially suspicious of him, Mortarion proved
            himself one of their kind, and moulded them into an army that at
            first defied the hunting parties of the overlords, and then turned
            the tables upon them. At length, the only one left was he who had
            been Mortarion's master, the High Overlord Necare, residing so high
            in the toxic strata that not even Mortarion could pursue him.
          </p>
          <p>
            When the Emperor came to Barbarus, the people greeted Him as their
            saviour, yet Mortarion was jealous and resentful of the adulation
            heaped upon this perfect stranger. Though his people could see that
            the Emperor was the primarch's sire, he himself saw only the
            differences. Where the stranger was noble of form and tanned of
            skin, Mortarion was pale and gaunt. When Mortarion refused to join
            Him, the Master of Mankind issued Mortarion a challenge -- if the
            primarch could defeat the last overlord of Barbarus, the Emperor
            would depart. If he could not, Mortarion must accept his fate and
            join the Great Crusade.
          </p>
          <p>
            Mortarion accepted the Emperor's challenge and ascended into the
            toxic clouds, higher than he had ever travelled before. At length,
            he reached the grim keep of Necare and raged for the high overlord
            to face him. Yet, even the primarch's superhumanly enhanced body
            could not withstand the toxic concentration of the atmosphere at
            that altitude, but as he succumbed with Necare about to slay him, he
            saw the golden figure of the Emperor step between him and the high
            overlord, entirely unaffected by the poisonous air. With a single
            stroke of His mighty, flaming blade, the Emperor felled the last
            overlord of Barbarus, and Mortarion acceded to his fate. Yet the
            primarch found himself riddled with anger and resentment at his
            gene-father for stealing away what he believed to be his rightful
            vengeance.
          </p>
          <p>
            Once the primarch was united with his Legion, it was found that the
            Death Guard, as they were renamed by their new master in memory of
            the army of the same name he had led against the overlords on
            Barbarus, were amongst the most resolute and resilient of all the
            Legions. Mortarion's warriors were ever to be found at the centre of
            the battle line, their strength and determination the inheritance of
            their primarch, making them the unbreakable core of any army of
            galactic conquest.
          </p>
          <p>
            When the Horus Heresy plunged the galaxy into civil war and
            Mortarion joined himself and his Legion to the rebellion of the
            Warmaster Horus out of his unresolved anger at the Emperor, the
            warriors of the Death Guard found themselves becalmed in the Warp on
            their way to the Siege of Terra and assailed by Warp-born plagues so
            virulent that not even their legendary resilience could withstand
            them. Soon, the entire Legion was beset by a sickness that bloated
            their bellies with corpse gas, caused ﬂesh to slough from their
            bodies and made these strongest and toughest of warriors into
            crippled wretches assailed by delirium.
          </p>
          <p>
            Though none can say exactly what forces acted upon the soul of the
            primarch of the Death Guard, whether he was already damned or
            whether he made his pact in some state of fever, he called out for
            deliverance, and his call must have been answered. When finally the
            Death Guard Legion's ﬂeet emerged from the Warp, its vessels and its
            warriors were entirely changed.
          </p>
          <p>
            Their once-gleaming white and grey armour was stained with filth,
            and the noble warriors were transformed into walking hives of death
            and abomination. Worse still, the "Plague Marines" of the Death
            Guard were now hosts for the most virulent afﬂictions that their new
            patron, the Plague God Nurgle, could concoct. Condemned to a
            deathless state of eternal decay, the Death Guard would spread their
            pestilent diseases the length and breadth of the galaxy for the
            greater glory of Chaos.
          </p>
          <p>
            With the end of the Horus Heresy, Mortarion led his Legion into the
            Eye of Terror, and while others had splintered into countless
            warbands, the Death Guard remained largely whole, thanks in no small
            part to their legendary strength and resilience. Mortarion brought
            them to a world that would become known simply as the Plague Planet,
            which he moulded into a new and despicable form, making it a virtual
            copy of lost Barbarus.
          </p>
          <p>
            To this day, Mortarion's Death Guard launch their assaults through
            the Cadian Gate and into the galaxy beyond, sometimes in large
            bodies and at others lending strength to allied Chaos forces.
            Wherever they travel they spread the joyful, exuberant poxes of
            Nurgle, gifting those who would know eternal life with the choicest
            of the Plague God's blessings. There have been numerous occasions
            when previously unknown plagues have swept the defence lines of
            otherwise static Imperial fronts, followed solar hours later by an
            overwhelming enemy advance. Many amongst the Imperial high command
            ascribe such instances to the Death Guard, and are fearful of what
            vile diseases they might concoct next.

          <p>
            Mortarion, also known as the "Pale King," the "Death Lord" or the
            "Prince of Decay" after he turned to Chaos, was one of the original
            twenty Imperial primarchs created by the Emperor of Mankind.
          </p>
          <p>
            He was given command of the Death Guard Space Marine Legion on the
            arrival of the Emperor to his homeworld of Barbarus, but he turned
            to the service of Chaos during the Horus Heresy.
          </p>
          <p>
            At present, Mortarion is the greatest Daemon Prince of Nurgle and
            the Daemon Primarch of the Death Guard Chaos Space Marines.
          </p>
          <p>
            He recently returned to Imperial space for the first time in ten
            thousand standard years when he led the forces of the Plague God in
            the invasion of the Realm of Ultramar during the Plague Wars.
