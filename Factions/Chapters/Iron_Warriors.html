            The Iron Warriors are one of the nine First Founding Traitor Legions
            of Chaos Space Marines that turned to the service of Chaos during
            the Horus Heresy and now fight to overthrow the Imperium of Man.
          </p>
          <p>
            The Iron Warriors, who were originally the IVth Legion of Space
            Marines, specialised in the breaking of sieges and assaults on
            static fortifications, which made them great rivals of the Imperial
            Fists Legion, said to construct the greatest static defences in the
            Imperium. It was this rivalry between the Legions, and between their
            primarchs Perturabo and the Imperial Fists' Rogal Dorn, that helped
            turn the Iron Warriors to Chaos.
          </p>
          <p>
            Like the members of the Adeptus Mechanicus and the Loyalist Iron
            Hands Chapter, the Iron Warriors have a strong predilection for
            replacing parts of their body with cybernetic enhancements. When
            struck with a mutational "gift" from the Ruinous Powers, most Iron
            Warriors simply cut off the mutated appendage, if possible, and
            replace it with a mechanical one.
          </p>
          <p>
            The Iron Warriors were the Emperor's finest siege troops and their
            primarch, Perturabo, was the equal of Rogal Dorn in the arts of
            fortification and strategy. Yet, Perturabo felt himself side-lined
            by his brother primarch, whose every proud boast was, to the master
            of the Iron Warriors, a barbed insult. When the Horus Heresy came,
            it was perhaps inevitable that the two primarchs should find
            themselves on opposite sides of the galactic civil war.
          </p>
          <p>
            Perturabo grew up upon the world of Olympia, a mountainous planet
            divided into constantly warring city-states. The infant was found by
            the servants of Dammekos, the so-called "Tyrant of Lochos," and
            raised by him as his own. The young primarch never fully accepted
            his lot, and became cold and mistrustful of others. Despite his
            aloof demeanour, Perturabo learned from the culture in which he
            found himself the arts of the siege, for Olympia's warring
            city-states afforded plenty of opportunity to study both the theory
            and the practise of this highly specialised branch of warfare.
          </p>
          <p>
            When the Great Crusade finally reached Olympia in 849.M30 and the
            Emperor told Perturabo of his place in the wider galaxy, the
            primarch pledged his devotion to the ﬂedgling Imperium, and assumed
            the mantle of the primarch of the Iron Warriors Legion. According to
            established Imperial practise, the primarch was declared lord of the
            world on which he had been raised, effectively deposing his adopted
            father, and the IV Legion began the process of inducting new
            recruits from the most able candidates amongst its peoples.
          </p>
          <p>
            In the campaigns that followed, the Iron Warriors proved themselves
            amongst the most able siege troops in the Emperor's armies.
            Perturabo was possessed of a keen, cold, and calculating mind
            well-suited to the highly technical aspects of such a style of
            warfare. Furthermore, he was gifted with an affinity with advanced
            technology, and able to debate the finer points of the most esoteric
            arts with the highest placed adepts of the ancient Mechanicum. The
            Iron Warriors received cross training on Mars, further refining this
            specialisation, until only the Imperial Fists of Rogal Dorn could
            equal their expertise. World after world that rejected the future
            espoused by the Emperor's Iterators capitulated when confronted with
            the prospect of a protracted siege by the Iron Warriors, and
            countless worlds were brought to Imperial Compliance that would
            otherwise have been devastated in bitter, and ultimately pointless
            wars.
          </p>
          <p>
            Yet, Perturabo appears to have grown ever more resentful of his role
            within the Great Crusade, and perhaps in an effort to prove his
            superiority over Dorn and others amongst his brother primarchs, he
            accepted ever more arduous missions on behalf of his Legion. Worlds
            considered by others as unbreakable were cracked open by the
            methodical application of overwhelming force, yet this approach to
            war took a remorseless toll even on the transhuman Space Marines.
          </p>
          <p>
            Gruelling preparation culminated in brief but extreme violence, and
            soon the Iron Warriors came to prefer a besieged defender to defy
            them rather than to surrender, so that the pent-up pressure of siege
            warfare could be released in the moment of their total defeat. To
            make matters worse, the Iron Warriors came to be utilised as
            garrison troops, small forces detached from the Legion and tasked
            with guarding the worlds they had worked so hard to bring to
            Compliance. While other primarchs refused point-blank to see their
            Legions used in such a way, Perturabo acceded, though with
            ever-poorer grace.
          </p>
          <p>
            As the tragic outbreak of the Horus Heresy grew closer, it appears
            that Perturabo was put under ever increasing pressure, and as a
            result the fires of his bitterness were stoked to a raging inferno.
            Some have postulated that it was the Warmaster Horus himself who,
            time after time, engineered events and adjusted deployments to the
            primarch's detriment and further stoked his sense of tremendous
            grievance. Whatever the truth, events came to a head when, following
            the death of the Tyrant of Lochos, the people of Olympia rebelled
            against the rule of the Iron Warriors.
          </p>
          <p>
            Perturabo's anger was finally unleashed, and upon his return to his
            homeworld, the primarch enacted such fearsome vengeance that
            countless innocents were slaughtered and entire cities burned. In
            the aftermath of his vengeance, Perturabo knew utter despair, barely
            able to comprehend the crimes he had committed in his rage. But
            before he could set about righting his terrible deed, word came of
            the Warmaster's virus-bombing of Isstvan III, and the Iron Warriors
            were ordered to confront the rebels and bring them to justice.
            History records little of the machinations Horus must surely have
            enacted in order to turn the bitter Perturabo to the cause of the
            Traitors, but whatever the truth, the Iron Warriors turned upon
            their brothers at the Drop Site Massacre on Isstvan V, and in so
            doing sealed their damnation for all time.
          </p>
          <p>
            At last freed of the constraints that had bound him, Perturabo gave
            free reign to his most destructive urges, laying waste to world
            after world in the Warmaster's service. While one part of the IV
            Legion turned Olympia and its surrounding star systems into an
            "Empire of Iron," another lent its expertise to the Siege of Terra,
            and at last, the gene-sons of Perturabo could test themselves
            against those of Rogal Dorn. It cannot be known whether Dorn's
            masterfully-constructed defences would have proved the undoing of
            the Iron Warriors, for the Warmaster was slain before the matter
            could be fully determined. Those Iron Warriors that had taken part
            in the Siege of Terra ﬂed to the Eye of Terror with the remainder of
            the Traitors, while those that had established their own empire
            around Olympia prepared themselves for the inevitable assault by the
            Loyalist Legions in what became known as the campaigns of the Great
            Scouring.
          </p>
          <p>
            In a reversal of fortune typical of the grim epoch that ushered in
            the Age of the Imperium, the Imperial Fists were amongst those who
            laid siege to these Iron Warriors, and while the Traitors were
            eventually dislodged, it was only after a solar-decade-long campaign
            that culminated in them detonating their nucleonic stockpiles and
            reducing Olympia to a blasted waste.
          </p>
          <p>
            Perhaps the most infamous of all of Perturabo's campaigns, and, so
            it is said, the deed that earned him the dark blessing of apotheosis
            to a Daemon Primarch, took place upon the world of Sebastus IV.
            Here, the primarch constructed the most fearsome of fortifications,
            a mighty fastness ringed all about with kilometre after kilometre of
            trenches, redoubts, minefelds and razor wire. While most fortresses
            serve the purpose of defending something, and are thus limited in
            their utility, the so-called "Eternal Fortress" had been constructed
            with but one purpose in mind -- to defy the proud boasts of Rogal
            Dorn and to lure him into a trap from which he could not escape.
          </p>
          <p>
            Despite the protestations of his brother the Imperial Regent Roboute
            Guilliman, Dorn succumbed to Perturabo's boast that none could take
            his fortress, and led the entire Imperial Fists Legion into what
            would later become known as the "Iron Cage." What followed was death
            and destruction on an unprecedented scale. Not since the height of
            the Horus Heresy had a Space Marine Legion suffered such losses as
            the Imperial Fists incurred as they dropped straight into the midst
            of a grand entrapment. As more of his warriors fell to the
            stratagems and rouses of the well-prepared Iron Warriors, Dorn's
            captains counselled the Legion should fall back and regroup, for
            they could accept what he could not -- the Imperial Fists had been
            bested, and in a siege no less.
          </p>
          <p>
            At length, Rogal Dorn could not, and did not, give the order to
            withdraw. Rather, Roboute Guilliman decided that he could not stand
            by as his brother brought about his own defeat and that of his
            Legion, and so he deployed the Ultramarines to relieve the Imperial
            Fists. Faced with two entire Legions, Perturabo evacuated his own,
            knowing that he had achieved what he had set out to do. By the end
            of the battle, the Imperial Fists had lost an incredible four
            hundred battle-brothers, with many more wounded. Perturabo offered
            up the precious, uncorrupted gene-seed his Legion had taken from the
            Imperial Fists to the Chaos Gods for the use of the Traitor Legions,
            and apotheosis was his reward.
          </p>
          <p>
            In the 41st Millennium, the Iron Warriors remain a constant thorn in
            the side of the Emperor's realm. From their Daemon World of
            Medrengard in the Eye of Terror, Iron Warriors warbands under the
            command of various Warsmiths often strike out in search of new
            spoils and technology to enhance their own capabilities. The Iron
            Warriors work closely with the Hereteks of the Dark Mechanicum and
            have proven capable of unleashing fiendishly potent new Daemon
            Engines upon the servants of the Imperium.

            <h3>Perturabo</h3>
            <img src="../../images/Primarch/IW Primarch.webp" alt="" />
          </div>
          <p>
            Perturabo, sometimes called the "Lord of Iron," "The Breaker" and
            "The Hammer of Olympia," is the primarch of the Iron Warriors
            Traitor Legion, one of the original twenty Space Marine Legions.
            Weaned on war and intrigue in the strife-ridden courts of his
            homeworld of Olympia, Perturabo was a grim warrior and master of
            technological arcana who wielded logic and the mathematics of
            warfare as keenly as he did a blade and bolter.
          </p>
          <p>
            The Lord of Iron was taciturn to the point of insult, preferring to
            harbour his thoughts against the threat of treachery, even amongst
            his kin. Few would call him friend, but none could fault his ability
            to wage a campaign and plot the most direct course to victory
            regardless of the cost and despite the strain put on him and his
            IVth Legion during the long years of the Great Crusade. His word was
            as unbreakable as iron.
          </p>
          <p>
            Unlike his brother primarchs, many of whom embraced the Emperor of
            Mankind's Great Crusade with near-fanatical devotion, Perturabo
            thought of it simply as a task that his sworn duty to the Emperor
            compelled him to pursue. His conquests were innumerable, but
            unremarked and unthanked, as his Iron Warriors brought many worlds
            into the Imperium of Man, but he left behind him shattered planets
            on the brink of extinction by his brutal, if effective, strategies.
          </p>
          <p>
            So it was that, rotting from within with loathing and bitter spite,
            the iron facade the Iron Warriors Legion presented to the Imperium
            obfuscated the extent of how rapidly and how deeply it had descended
            into homicidal madness, until at last it was called on to help in
            the punishment of the rebellious Warmaster Horus Lupercal at Isstvan
            V, and the dark truth was revealed.
          </p>
          <p>
            Perturabo arrived at Isstvan V in the wake of the bloody
            pacification of his homeworld of Olympia, a campaign that wiped out
            the entire population, and some claim tipped Perturabo and his
            Legion over the edge of madness and fully into the abyss of betrayal
            during the subsequent Drop Site Massacre, an infamous action that
            will echo forever in the history of the Imperium.
          </p>
          <p>
            In the wake of the Drop Site Massacre, Perturabo left the blasted
            carcass of Isstvan V, carrying his fallen brother Ferrus Manus'
            warhammer Forgebreaker as a token of his new allegiance to Horus'
            treacherous cause.
          </p>
          <p>
            Following the tragic events of the Horus Heresy and his Legion's
            subsequent flight into the Eye of Terror, Perturabo has since
            ascended to Daemon Prince status by the will of the Ruinous Powers
            and currently resides within the Eye of Terror on the Daemon World
            of Medrengard./p>
