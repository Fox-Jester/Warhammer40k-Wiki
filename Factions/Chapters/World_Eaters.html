            The World Eaters are one of the Traitor Legions of Chaos Space
            Marines who now inhabit the Warp rift known as the Eye of Terror in
            the Imperium of Man's Segmentum Obscurus.
          </p>
          <p>
            The World Eaters, originally known as the War Hounds, were also once
            the XIIth Legion of the twenty First Founding Space Marine Legions,
            and one of the first to betray the Emperor of Mankind for the
            service of Chaos and the Warmaster Horus.
          </p>
          <p>
            This Legion was a collection of nearly inhuman monsters long before
            Horus became corrupted and monsters they would remain, only with
            what little remained of their restraint and their Humanity stripped
            away after their fall to Chaos.The World Eaters are now the
            dedicated servants of the Blood God Khorne, the Chaos God of war and
            murder, and live for nothing more than to spill blood in his name.
            The World Eaters' Primarch Angron was one of the first of the Space
            Marine Primarchs to join with Horus when he turned against the
            Emperor and began the Horus Heresy.
          </p>
          <p>
            The World Eaters are now the dedicated servants of the Blood God
            Khorne, the Chaos God of war and murder, and live for nothing more
            than to spill blood in his name. The World Eaters' Primarch Angron
            was one of the first of the Space Marine Primarchs to join with
            Horus when he turned against the Emperor and began the Horus Heresy.
          </p>
          <p>
            The Legion is no longer united, having long ago surrendered to the
            pure bloodlust inspired by their patron Khorne. Instead they now
            operate as separate warbands of Chaos Space Marines who seek to
            spread death and terror in the name of the Blood God across the
            galaxy.
          </p>
          <p>
            The World Eaters were known from their very inception as the most
            brutal and direct of assault troops. Their fearsome doctrine was
            very much the result of the early life of their Primarch.
          </p>
          <p>
            Angron was raised on the world of Nuceria as a slave-warrior, driven
            by a cybernetic cranial implant called the Butcher's Nails into
            savage bouts of uncontrollable violence for the entertainment of the
            masses.
          </p>
          <p>
            But Angron did not remain a slave for long, for he was possessed of
            the indomitable will of a Primarch, and he rallied his fellow
            gladiators to break the chains of their bondage, slay their
            oppressors and escape to freedom.
          </p>
          <p>
            Having led his army of escaped slave-warriors into the mountains,
            Angron found himself hunted relentlessly, until only a thousand or
            so of his companions survived, cornered by five entire armies of
            Nucerian overseers. Determined to sell their lives dearly, Angron
            and his warriors dug their own graves, a signal to the enemy that no
            quarter would be asked and the fight would be to the death.
          </p>
          <p>
            But Angron was not to fall the following morning, for it transpired
            that the Emperor had been observing his deeds from orbit. The
            Emperor came before His long lost gene-son and told him, as He had
            the other Primarchs, of the purpose for which he was created. Yet
            Angron rejected the Emperor's words, determined instead to fight and
            to die at the side of his fellow slave-warriors.
          </p>
          <p>
            As the sun rose and the encircling armies closed on Angron's band of
            warriors, the Emperor saw that not even a mighty Primarch could
            prevail against such odds. As battle was joined, the Primarch was
            teleported to the Emperor's vessel, and though he was saved from
            certain death as all his comrades died in his absence, he never
            forgave his gene-father for what he would forever view as a gross
            betrayal of a warrior's vows to his battle-kin.
          </p>
          <p>
            Taking his position as Primarch of the XIIth Legion, which he
            renamed the "World Eaters," Angron instigated a program of
            replicating the cranial implants he himself had been fitted with as
            a slave-warrior, knowing that the devices granted such advantages in
            speed, aggression and strength that no enemy in the galaxy could
            stand before his Legion once all had received them.
          </p>
          <p>
            Yet, it was soon found that the implants were based on lost
            technology of which the ancient Mechanicum was ignorant, and while
            they used Angron's own implant as a template, they were never able
            to fully recreate it.
          </p>
          <p>
            Nevertheless, the Mechanicum did succeed in creating devices that
            greatly boosted the abilities of the bearer, making him stronger and
            even more aggressive than he already was. The World Eaters became
            the most effective shock troops in the Imperium's armies, proving
            time and again that none could stand before them.
          </p>
          <p>
            Yet, the glories came at a price, for the aggression unlocked by the
            implants proved all but impossible to temper once given full reign,
            and at the world of Ghenna, an entire planetary population was
            butchered in a single solar night by World Eaters unable or
            unwilling to deny the bloodlust unleashed by the implants. Angron
            was censured, and ordered by the Emperor to cease the practise of
            implanting his warriors in such a way, yet he continued regardless.
          </p>
          <p>
            When the Horus Heresy erupted, Angron's Legion was at the very
            forefront of the bloodshed. Most notably, the World Eaters led the
            assault upon the walls of the Imperial Palace, taking the breach
            with no regards to their own losses. By this point, the World Eaters
            had given full vent to their most destructive urges.
          </p>
          <p>
            While Angron had once been a great man possessed of a fearsome sense
            of martial pride and honour, now he was a frothing, blood-soaked
            berserker Daemon Prince, as were his warriors. Any reason that had
            survived the implant process was driven from their minds, replaced
            with the will of Khorne, the Blood God.
          </p>
          <p>
            It is said that when the Emperor defeated Horus and the hordes of
            Chaos assaulting Terra were finally routed, the World Eaters were
            the last of their number to quit the field of battle.
          </p>
          <p>
            None can say how close the World Eaters came to destroying the
            palace, or whether they would have come face to face with the
            Emperor Himself had not Horus lowered the shields of his Battle
            Barge, precipitating the final confrontation in orbit.
          </p>
          <p>
            In the aftermath of the Horus Heresy, the World Eaters descended to
            new depths of bloodlust and destruction, reaving across the already
            shattered Imperium before plunging into the twisted depths of the
            Eye of Terror. None can say exactly what happened within the Eye,
            but it is apparent that the Legion all but consumed itself in a
            bitter internecine conﬂict that saw it fractured into countless
            smaller warbands.
          </p>
          <p>
            Perhaps the Blood God was pleased with the slaughter, for Angron had
            already been raised up to become a Daemon Prince, even as his Legion
            ceased to exist as a coherent whole.
          </p>
          <p>
            Though its Daemon Primarch would periodically gather the disparate
            warbands into something resembling the glory of the old Legion, the
            World Eaters were condemned to roam the battlefields of the galaxy
            in search of war, individual squads and warbands joining other Chaos
            forces and fighting for nothing more than the opportunity to spill
            blood and take skulls.

            Angron, sometimes called the "Red Angel," and originally named
            Angronius of Nuceria, the "Lord of the Red Sands," is the primarch
            of the World Eaters Traitor Legion.
          </p>
          <p>
            He was the most bloody-handed and savage of the primarchs. When
            Horus began his rebellion against the Emperor, Angron was quick to
            join in his treachery because of his long-lasting grudge against the
            Master of Mankind for the Emperor's failure to rescue his beloved
            fellow enslaved gladiators from death on his homeworld of Nuceria,
            but his only true master was the rage and bloodlust within him.
          </p>
          <p>
            He fell to Chaos during the Horus Heresy and was transformed into a
            Daemon Prince of the Blood God Khorne in the campaign known as the
            Shadow Crusade before that conflict had ended.
          </p>
          <p>
            He was most recently banished to the Warp after he unleashed the
            First War of Armageddon upon the Imperium of Man in 474.M41, though
            since the opening of the Great Rift in the Era Indomitus, he has
            become active once more in realspace, most recently during the Arks
            of Omen Campaign.
