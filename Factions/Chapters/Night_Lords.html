            The Night Lords were originally the VIIIth Legion of Space Marines
            created during the First Founding. They betrayed the trust of the
            Emperor of Mankind during the Horus Heresy of the early 31st
            Millennium and became one of the 9 Traitor Legions of Chaos Space
            Marines.
          </p>
          <p>
            The Night Lords do not worship any of the four major Chaos Gods
            individually, but acknowledge them equally in the form of Chaos
            Undivided as they ruthlessly spread terror and fear amongst the
            galaxy's inhabitants. The Night Lords are experts in the use of
            terror tactics to win battles and demoralise their foes before the
            main combat even begins.
          </p>
          <p>
            The Night Lords are synonymous with terror and murder, for their
            favoured mode of warfare is the unfettered application of brutal,
            overwhelming force. They show no mercy whatsoever, eschewing all
            subtlety and guile for wanton bloodshed and destruction. While such
            an approach might appear mindless, at one time it was different.
          </p>
          <p>
            Ten millennia ago, the Night Lords' Primarch Konrad Curze was driven
            to acts of extreme violence by a deep-rooted desire to punish the
            guilty and impose order upon the anarchy in which he grew up. Only
            later, when the doomed primarch surrendered his soul to the Ruinous
            Powers was his relentless drive for justice perverted into the form
            it now takes among his gene-sons.
          </p>
          <p>
            While many of the primarchs were raised by those peoples they found
            themselves amongst after the Ruinous Powers scattered them to the
            corners of the galaxy, Konrad Curze grew to maturity in very
            different circumstances. The world of Nostramo was a lightless
            industrial waste, its cities teeming and anarchic and its main
            export the raw adamantium found beneath the surface. Curze survived
            as a wild thing, living in the lowest depths of the hive cities and
            competing for food with the vermin and scum of the sewers.
          </p>
          <p>
            Like all of the primarchs, he matured quickly, bearing witness as he
            did so to the most horrific excesses of Nostromo's corrupt society.
            Murder was rife and the people lived in constant fear. No natural
            light lit the alleys and the depths, and all manner of fell
            criminals lurked within them. Soon, Curze began to prey upon these
            criminals, mounting their mutilated corpses where all could see and
            take heed. The terror that stalked the streets exacting vengeance
            upon the lawless soon became known as the "Night Haunter," and so
            fearful were the people of his judgement that soon all, not just the
            criminals, locked themselves inside their dwellings, and a peace of
            sorts was imposed upon the dark world.
          </p>
          <p>
            As with most of the primarchs, by the time the Emperor found Konrad
            Curze he had risen to a position of dominance over his world.
            Curze's rule as Nostramo's "Dark King" was not one of beneficence,
            however, but one of fear and repression. The people of Nostromo had
            been entirely delivered from the predations of criminals, but not by
            way of enlightenment or the imposition of a new legal order. Rather,
            the people knew that even the slightest malfeasance would result in
            Curze himself visiting death upon the criminal. When the Emperor
            presented Himself to the primarch, the people believed that a new
            age had arrived. Yet, when the Emperor took Curze back to Terra,
            Nostromo was plunged back into anarchy, for no one was left to
            enforce order.
          </p>
          <p>
            Despite the brutality of his methods, Konrad Curze's actions appear
            to have been motivated by a deep, if twisted, sense of justice. In
            the brutal underworld in which he had matured, the primarch had
            learned that only total dominance would suffice and that to show any
            sign of weakness was to invite treachery. Even when Curze joined his
            brothers in the glorious campaigns of the Great Crusade, he appeared
            to hold to such views, eschewing such notions as hope and optimism
            which drove others to instead believe in the dark realities of the
            natural order.
          </p>
          <p>
            He remained sullen and introspective, and shunned the companionship
            of his brothers. He preferred the company of the warriors of his own
            Legion, the Night Lords whom he indoctrinated into his favoured
            methods of combat and fear-driven control.
          </p>
          <p>
            Even before the outset of the Horus Heresy, the Night Lords were
            using methods most others would have denounced as brutally
            unnecessary, inhumane and cruel. The Night Lords conquered utterly
            those who did not welcome the coming of the Great Crusade, crushing
            all opposition to Imperial rule in such an overwhelming and brutal
            fashion that no others would dare resist.
          </p>
          <p>
            As with so many of the primarchs who rebelled against the Emperor
            and all they had been created to stand for, Konrad Curze crossed a
            line from which there was no return before his betrayal. Having
            physically clashed before the start of the Horus Heresy with Rogal
            Dorn, he was censured by his brothers, who convened a council to
            consider the matter of their darkling brother's seeming mental
            instability. Curze however slew his guards on the world of Cheraut
            and ﬂed, outrunning his pursuers and returning to Nostromo.
          </p>
          <p>
            There, in 984.M30, he enacted his final revenge upon a society that
            had descended back into the corruption and criminality from which he
            had strived so hard to deliver it. The Night Lords' ﬂeet targetted a
            weak point in the planet's crust and unleashed every weapon in their
            arsenal, destroying Nostromo and, some would say, damning Konrad
            Curze for all eternity.
          </p>
          <p>
            When the Warmaster Horus revealed his treachery and plunged the
            galaxy into the fires of civil war, Curze embraced the Traitors'
            cause and threw himself into a bitter campaign of death and
            destruction, giving full vent to his most violent urges. It was
            never sufficient to simply defeat an enemy army. Curze taught his
            Legion to make an example of those who stood against them, to
            destroy their enemies' cities, slay their kin and display their
            broken corpses as a message to all others. His Legion wreaked bloody
            and savage murder across the galaxy, which continued even after
            Horus' defeat at the height of the Siege of Terra.
          </p>
          <p>
            Curze did not fall to Chaos during the Horus Heresy, and neither did
            he receive the dark blessing of the Ruinous Powers in the form of
            apotheosis to Daemonhood like his Traitor brothers. Instead, he met
            his end at the hand of an assassin of the Callidus Temple.
          </p>
          <p>
            It is known that throughout his life Curze was struck with powerful
            psychic visions of the worst of all possible futures, and that his
            last had been a foretelling that he would die at the hand of one
            such as she. These visions were part of Curze's genetic inheritance
            from the Emperor, allowing him to share in a limited and greatly
            skewed way the Master of Mankind's potent precognitive abilities.
          </p>
          <p>
            Alone of all the primarchs, Curze welcomed his death, apparently
            allowing the Callidus Assassin M'Shen to take his life. It is said
            that in so doing he attained that which he had always craved --
            vindication. The primarch's acceptance of his own fate confirmed his
            bleak worldview of a hypocritical Imperium of Man dedicated to
            immoral methods to achieve its idealistic goals, granting him a
            victory he could never attain under the rule of his father.
          </p>
          <p>
            It is a view still held by the gene-sons who survived him to wreak
            an eternal campaign of blood and shadowed terror against the hated
            Imperium of the Corpse Emperor in their Long War.

            <h3>Konrad Curze</h3>

          </div>
          <p>
            Konrad Curze, better known as the "Night Haunter," the name he
            preferred, and sometimes as the "Dark King," the "King of Terrors,"
            and "The Last Judge," was one of the 20 superhuman primarchs created
            by the Emperor of Mankind in the late 30th Millennium and was the
            master of the Night Lords Traitor Legion of Heretic Astartes.
          </p>
          <p>
            Night Haunter was tortured all his life by terrible, dark
            precognitive visions of the future, and this generated a level of
            psychic anguish and despair that set him apart from his fellow
            primarchs. His psyche badly damaged by the difficulties of his early
            life, Curze never recovered his mental balance and sought only
            oblivion from the pain of his existence.
          </p>
          <p>
            As a result of his afflictions, he was an utterly brutal and savage
            warrior who believed in the use of fear as the most potent weapon
            against one's foes, and he taught his Astartes to be as brutal and
            savage as necessary to put down the enemy. Night Haunter did not
            enjoy his role as an Imperial war leader and was the only one of the
            primarchs who showed little affection for his "sons," the Space
            Marines of the VIIIth Legion that had been created from his genetic
            template.
          </p>
          <p>
            He was executed, some scholars believe willingly, by the Callidus
            Assassin M'Shen on the world of Tsagualsa in the Eastern Fringe of
            the galaxy immediately following the end of the Horus Heresy in the
            early 31st Millennium. His VIIIth Legion, without his leadership,
            then broke up into competing warbands of Heretic Astartes and fled
            into the Eye of Terror with the rest of the Traitor Legions.
