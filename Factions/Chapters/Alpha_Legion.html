            The Alpha Legion is the Chaos Space Marine Traitor Legion about whom
            the least is known. The Alpha Legion was once the XXth Legion of
            Astartes created during the First Founding by the Emperor of Mankind
            to carry out His Great Crusade to reunite all of Humanity in a new
            golden age under His rule. They are experts in infiltration, covert
            operations, misdirection and diversion tactics, and their armies
            contain many Chaos Cultists and other mortal agents in addition to
            regular Heretic Astartes.
          </p>
          <p>
            The Alpha Legion's primarch was named Alpharius, and was actually
            one of the identical twin Primarchs Alpharius Omegon, two brilliant
            and secretive sons of the Emperor, one of whom was believed slain at
            the Battle of Pluto during the Horus Heresy by Rogal Dorn of the
            Imperial Fists and the other reportedly after the end of the Heresy
            by Roboute Guilliman, the primarch of the Ultramarines. Despite its
            seeming allegiance to Chaos, a closer scrutiny of the Alpha Legion's
            known history indicates that their seeming service to Chaos
            Undivided might actually be the greatest deception they have played
            upon the Imperium.
          </p>
          <p>
            With true accounts of the Horus Heresy the purview of the Ordo
            Malleus and only known to the bulk of Humanity as legend and myth,
            records of most of the Traitor Legions are very hard to come by.
            This is even more the case with the Alpha Legion, because the XXth
            Legion embraced misdirection and stealth as its primary means of
            conducting war. The Alpha Legion was the last of the Legiones
            Astartes to be united with its primarch, only serving under them for
            a few solar decades before the Horus Heresy erupted.
          </p>
          <p>
            The Legion was known as secretive in the extreme, favouring cunning
            ruses and clandestine deployments, and as such very little is known
            of its deeds. While most accounts involving the Traitor Legions are
            unreliable, those that mention the Alpha Legion are regarded by most
            Imperial savants with outright skepticism. The misinformation
            surrounding the Alpha Legion even extends to the nature and identity
            of its primarch. Known to outsiders only by the cipher "Alpharius,"
            very little is known of the Legion's primarch besides his genius in
            implementing the most cunning of stratagems and tactics.
          </p>
          <p>
            It is said that Alpharius revelled in fighting in such a manner that
            his enemies only ever realised they were under attack at the very
            last moment. Such tactics are said to range from conventional ï¬‚ank
            attacks timed to strike at the precise moment when they would
            precipitate the enemy's complete collapse, to extended campaigns of
            infiltration, exploitation of partisan groups, undermining enemy
            command and control assets and spreading fear and suspicion through
            compromised communication networks.
          </p>
          <p>
            As Space Marines, the Alpha Legion was entirely capable of
            conducting the full range of military operations normally associated
            with these elite, transhuman warriors. However, it appears that
            Alpharius and his warriors were disposed towards the use of stealth
            and guile, preferring such tactics to more mundane approaches to
            war.
          </p>
          <p>
            This is said to have caused acrimony between Alpharius and Roboute
            Guilliman when the Alpha Legion was tasked with conquering the world
            of Tesstra Prime. The XXth Legion executed a masterful campaign in
            which every possible ruse and stratagem was utilised and the enemy
            defeated before he even realised he was fighting for his very
            existence, by which time he had suffered an estimated 90% losses.
          </p>
          <p>
            The primarch of the Ultramarines declared the campaign a grand waste
            of time and resources, claiming the target world could have been
            taken far quicker by conventional means. Alpharius replied that such
            an approach would have been "too easy," a view that Horus alone
            shared with him.
          </p>
          <p>
            The Alpha Legion is known to have taken part in the galaxy-spanning
            disaster that was the Horus Heresy, though as ever, its exact role
            is unclear. One thing is for certain, the XXth Legion was present at
            the Drop Site Massacre at Isstvan V, fighting in the second wave as
            one of the three Traitor Legions that only revealed their true
            colours when the savagely mauled Raven Guard, Salamanders and Iron
            Hands were falling back to the drop zone.
          </p>
          <p>
            Aside from this action, the Alpha Legion is largely absent from what
            accounts of the Horus Heresy remain in the 41st Millennium, only
            cropping up in a handful of places and often in contradictory
            fashion. The annals of the Space Wolves and White Scars both record
            battles against the Alpha Legion, and it appears that Alpharius
            revelled in the battles he fought against his erstwhile brothers.
          </p>
          <p>
            Yet, at the same time, he pursued his own strategy. Even after Horus
            was defeated at the Siege of Terra, the Alpha Legion continued
            fighting, all the while working its way towards the galactic east.
            As such, the Legion was not pursued into the Eye of Terror as so
            many others were, but became embroiled in a series of bitter
            confrontations against the Ultramarines, who themselves had been
            engaged in that region when the Warmaster had attacked Terra.
          </p>
          <p>
            Battle was joined at Eskrador, where the Ultramarines Primarch
            Roboute Guilliman proved himself the greatest of strategists when he
            predicted that the Alpha Legion would believe they could foresee the
            tactics he would utilise in the coming battle. For perhaps the only
            time in his life, Guilliman acted contrary to his own firmly-held
            military doctrines, and it was Alpharius who walked into a trap. The
            two primarchs faced one another in battle and Alpharius was defeated
            and seemingly slain, precipitating the collapse of the entire Alpha
            Legion.
          </p>
          <p>
            Or so it at first appeared. Having burned the Traitor primarch's
            body on a great pyre, Guilliman led his Legion against the remnants
            of the Alpha Legion, only to discover that far from collapsing, the
            Legion was mounting a series of cunning and often devastating
            counterstrikes. After many solar days of bitter fighting, Guilliman
            gave up hope of an honourable victory and departed Eskrador,
            ordering a massive orbital bombardment to finish the survivors off.
          </p>
          <p>
            Some have claimed that the entire battle was some grand ploy, though
            to what end none can say. Certainly, the Alpha Legion fought in the
            manner of the mythical beast that adorns their armour -- the hydra
            -- for each time one head is cut off, another moves in to replace
            it.

            <h3>Alpharius Omegon</h3>
            <img src="../../images/Primarch/AL primarch.jpg" alt="" />
          </div>
          <p>
            Alpharius Omegon, also known as the "Aleph Null," "The Hydra," the
            "Threefold Serpent," "The Final Configuration" and the "Last
            Primarch," was one of the twenty primarchs created by the Emperor of
            Mankind in the earliest days of the Imperium of Man, just after the
            end of the Age of Strife in the 30th Millennium. In truth, Alpharius
            Omegon was actually a pair of identical twin brothers, one named
            Alpharius and the other Omegon.
          </p>
          <p>
            Of all the primarchs of the Legiones Astartes, Alpharius was without
            a doubt the most steeped in mystery, legend, contradiction and
            deliberate falsification. The primarch of the Alpha Legion shrouded
            himself in mystery, often moving unseen even amongst the ranks of
            his own Legion.
          </p>
          <p>
            However, when the time came to cast off the cloak of misdirection,
            Alpharius was as awe-inspiring a being as any of his brother
            primarchs. Clad in armour forged in the manner of some terrifying
            beast of ancient Terran myth and armed with a fearsome panoply of
            weapons of unknown provenance, Alpharius bestrode the battlefield
            like a figure from legend.
          </p>
          <p>
            Like the hydra he and his XXth Legion had taken as their symbol,
            Alpharius fought by repeated attacks from multiple and unexpected
            quarters. None could predict where or how the primarch would strike,
            what weapons he would bring to bear or which of his many different
            forms would fight at his side. In many cases, the enemy were not
            even aware they were fighting the Alpha Legion until the very moment
            battle was joined, at which point they were already doomed to total
            and utter defeat at the hands of this most cunning, devious and
            duplicitous of all the primarchs of the ancient Space Marine
            Legions.
          </p>
          <p>
            Like the other primarchs, Alpharius and his twin brother Omegon were
            transported from the Emperor's gene-lab beneath the Himalazian
            (Himalayan) Mountains of Terra through the Warp by the Chaos Gods
            and placed on a far-away world in an attempt to prevent the coming
            of the Age of the Imperium and the expansion of the ordered Imperium
            of Man across the galaxy.
          </p>
          <p>
            Alpharius Omegon was eventually rediscovered by Primarch Horus and
            sent to meet his father the Emperor on Terra, who placed him (and
            secretly, his twin brother) in command of the XXth Legion, the
            so-called Alpha Legion, during the Great Crusade of the late 30th
            Millennium.
          </p>
          <p>
            It should be noted that the Alpha Legion's trademark secrecy
            extended to the records of their primarch. There is little recorded
            information on his biographical background or where his homeworld
            originated, and almost all of what is currently known by the
            Imperium about this enigmatic primarch comes from the information
            provided by former Inquisitor Kravin of the Ordo Malleus.
          </p>
          <p>
            Inquisitor Kravin was subsequently believed to have been tainted by
            the Alpha Legion and his current whereabouts are unknown. Hence,
            much of the Imperial data concerning the Last Primarch could be
            considered suspect, and indeed there are some who believe the whole
            Kravin affair was an Alpha Legion plot to plant misinformation in
            Imperial records.
          </p>
          <p>
            The greatest secret of the Alpha Legion's primarch is apparently
            told to no one outside the XXth Legion, and has always been thus.
            For, unlike any of the other primarchs, Alpharius actually has an
            identical twin: Omegon. It is unknown if the Emperor intended this
            when He created the Last Primarch, or was ever even aware that His
            final primarch's engineered embryo had split into two identical
            fetuses during their gestation before they were stolen away by the
            Ruinous Powers.
          </p>
          <p>
            Alpharius and Omegon were both the co-equal primarchs of the Alpha
            Legion, although "Alpharius" was the public face of the XXth Legion
            and appeared as the more senior of the two. Though as both primarchs
            were physically identical it was possible for them to switch places
            and have "Omegon" play the public role of the Alpha Legion's
            primarch.
          </p>
          <p>
            They have been described as "one soul in two bodies" and
            collectively have been referred to as simply "Alpharius Omegon".
            While the Astartes of the Alpha Legion made attempts to all look
            alike, both Alpharius and Omegon were still somewhat distinctive.
            Taller than the rest of the Astartes in their Legion as primarchs
            always were, slightly copper-skinned, bald and possessed of a heavy
            brow, they somewhat resembled their brother primarch Horus.
          </p>
          <p>
            Unlike the Lupercal, Alpharius and Omegon had piercing eyes that
            seemed to glitter, appearing to shift colour from a cold arctic blue
            to a shimmering green. The overall impression given by Alpharius
            Omegon was one of nobility and intelligence. One way to tell the
            twin primarchs apart was when Omegon was serving as the commander of
            his Effrit Stealth Squad; large portions of his power armour and
            other gear were painted black and otherwise darkened.
          </p>
          <p>
            The armour worn by Alpharius for his part was not particularly
            different from that of an ordinary Alpha Legionary. When such
            theatrics were required, both Alpharius and Omegon -- or one of
            their gene-sons serving as their surrogate -- could appear as regal
            and stunning as any other primarch.
