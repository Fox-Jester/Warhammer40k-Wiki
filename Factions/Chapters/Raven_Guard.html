            The Raven Guard is one of the original First Founding Chapters of
            the Space Marines and was originally the XIXth Space Marine Legion
            before the Second Founding and the adoption of the Codex Astartes.
          </p>
          <p>
            Named for a Terran avian seen by many cultures as the herald of fate
            and messenger of death, the Raven Guard have served the Emperor
            faithfully throughout the glories of the Unification Wars, the Great
            Crusade and the dark days of the Horus Heresy and beyond. From its
            earliest days, the warriors of the XIXth Legion were known as
            cunning and patient hunters, adept at biding their time until the
            moment to strike was at hand.
          </p>
          <p>
            When the Legion was united with its primarch -- Corvus Corax, the
            Raven Lord, the Deliverer, theirs was a form of warfare exemplifying
            speed, stealth and precision which was codified into their doctrine,
            and under the ivory-skinned, shadow-eyed and sable-haired Primarch,
            the XIXth Legion carved its name in the annals of the Great Crusade.
          </p>
          <p>
            As the tragic histories of the Horus Heresy were recounted, however,
            the Legion's glories were to be scattered upon the black sands of
            Isstvan V during the Drop Site Massacre, and the Imperium was almost
            shorn of one of its greatest champions. Though severely decimated,
            the Raven Guard would rise from the ashes of betrayal and go on to
            continue to serve the Imperium of Man as its protectors. As masters
            of the unseen war, they fight their battles with stealth and speed
            rather than fury and flames.For thousands of standard years, across
            thousands of worlds, they have continued to stalk the enemies of the
            Imperium as shadows of death, waiting for the perfect moment to
            deliver the killing blow before melting back into the darkness once
            more.
          </p>
          <p>
            For thousands of standard years, across thousands of worlds, they
            have continued to stalk the enemies of the Imperium as shadows of
            death, waiting for the perfect moment to deliver the killing blow
            before melting back into the darkness once more.
          </p>
          <p>
            The Raven Guard's homeworld is the planet called Deliverance, the
            airless mining moon of the Forge World Kiavahr, though its original
            name, before the Horus Heresy, was Lycaeus. The Raven Guard's
            fortress-monastery on Deliverance is known as the Ravenspire.
          </p>
          <p>
            The Raven Guard are known for their cool-headed, even intellectual
            temperament, their superb infiltration skills and skill at furious,
            close-quarters engagements. The Raven Guard are the masters of
            unseen and guerrilla warfare, only engaging in frontal assaults when
            no other option presents itself. The Raven Guard is also rightly
            feared for the potent units of Assault Marines and other close
            support units they field, who often prefer to wield a pair of
            Lightning Claws instead of the usual Bolt Pistol and chainsword.
            Kayvaan Shrike, the famed commander of the 3rd Company was the
            commanding officer of just such a unit before he ascended to the
            position of Chapter Master, known among the Raven Guard as the
            "Master of Shadows."
          </p>
          <p>
            The Raven Guard are the scions of the old XIXth Legion, whose
            Primarch Corvus Corax was said to have skin as white as ivory and
            eyes as black as night. The Legion suffered such devastating losses
            early in the Horus Heresy that its ability to inï¬‚uence the outcome
            of the calamitous galactic civil war was gravely limited. The cost
            of the Warmaster Horus' treachery would remain with the Raven Guard
            for millennia to come, shaping their doctrines, beliefs and their
            very destiny.
          </p>
          <p>
            The Raven Guard and their Successor Chapters are masters of
            infiltration and subterfuge, able to defeat an enemy of the Imperium
            with a precisely aimed and overwhelming assault in the manner of
            their primarch, whose loss they mourn to this very day.
          </p>
          <p>
            The Raven Guard were one of the three Legions assigned to the first
            wave of the drop assault against the Traitors at Isstvan V, the
            defining battle of the opening phase of the Horus Heresy. Falling
            prey to the Warmaster's perfidy, the Legion was devastated, and
            along with the Salamanders and the Iron Hands -- the so-called
            "Shattered Legions" -- forced to fall back to the Loyalists' drop
            zone where it could consolidate with the second wave of the assault
            and renew the attack on the Traitors.
          </p>
          <p>
            As history records, the Legions of the second wave were already in
            the sway of Horus, and the Raven Guard and their brothers were
            massacred. In a single battle, the Legion was reduced from their
            tens of thousands to a tiny fraction of their original numbers. The
            survivors were forced to return to the Legion's homeworld of
            Deliverance in order to rebuild their desperately reduced numbers.
            Upon his return to his homeworld, Corax is said to have brooded for
            countless solar days and nights, ordering that the most ancient
            texts concerning the processes the Emperor used to create the Space
            Marines be laid before him. Studying tomes not consulted in
            centuries, Corax found a way of saving his Legion from extinction,
            though he would hate himself for all time for the choice he was
            forced to make.
          </p>
          <p>
            By accelerating gene-seed replication and implantation in a manner
            not attempted since the wars in which the Emperor conquered Terra,
            the Legion's numbers could be restored. But the ancient texts had
            been placed under seals so dire that only a primarch or the Emperor
            Himself could have bypassed them, and with good reason. They warned
            of the consequences of accelerating the Astartes implantation
            process, consequences that Corax and his Legion were soon to witness
            first hand. No records remain of the results of Corax's
            experimentation, but there are legends that have been passed down
            through the generations. They speak of slavering, mutant monsters,
            some so hideously twisted they could not even hold a bolter. All
            were insane, their minds as blasted as their bodies by the rapid
            changes wrought upon them by the forbidden physiological processes.
          </p>
          <p>
            The Raven Guard never speak of these times, but secondary sources
            describe these mutated warriors as rabid, drooling creatures with
            distended limbs and impossibly overgrown musculature and skeletal
            structure, herded into battle by grim-faced, dark-eyed custodians.
          </p>
          <p>
            In the wake of the Horus Heresy, the XIXth Legion had only the
            numbers to form a handful of Successor Chapters according to the
            dictates of the Codex Astartes. Depending on the source, the Legion
            is said to have sired the Raptors, the Revilers and the Black Guard
            in addition to the Raven Guard Chapter itself during the Second
            Founding.
          </p>
          <p>
            It is said that by this time, Corax was all but consumed by the
            deeds he had allowed to be done to ensure his Legion's survival, and
            brooded upon the matter for an entire standard year, locked away in
            the highest chamber of his fortress-monastery. None heard from the
            primarch during that time, before he emerged gaunt and pale, and
            departed for the Eye of Terror never to be seen again.

            <h3>Corvus Corax</h3>
            <img src="../../images/Primarch/RG Primarch.webp" alt="" />
          </div>
          <p>
            Corvus Corax, also known as the "Raven Lord," "The Liberator," "The
            Deliverer," "Chooser of the Slain" and the "Shadowed Lord," is the
            currently missing primarch of the Raven Guard Chapter of Space
            Marines and its Successor Chapters.
          </p>
          <p>
            Corax presented a striking countenance, at least when he wished to
            be seen. His skin was alabaster white and he was possessed of
            shoulder length hair as black as the feathers of his namesake, the
            raven.
          </p>
          <p>
            Most remarkable and unsettling were his eyes, which appeared as
            entirely black shards of solid shadow. His sable power armour was
            edged with fine, golden figures and upon his back was mounted a
            jetpack formed into a pair of articulated, raven-like pinions that
            he wielded as a murderous, blood-edged weapon of war.
          </p>
          <p>
            Like most of the primarchs, Corax was blessed with an extensive
            armoury of artificer-wrought weapons, but he most often bore to war
            a pair of metre-long Lightning Claws and a coiled whip at his belt.
            The latter was carried as a reminder of the cruelty enacted upon the
            people of his homeworld of Lycaeus by the tyrannical guild of
            Kiavahr and with it countless enemies were laid low.
          </p>
          <p>
            Though few even amongst his gene-sons know of it, Corax is blessed
            with the ability to pass unnoticed should he will it, this
            preternatural ability allowing him to slip from the perception of
            his enemies even when he was in plain view.
          </p>
          <p>
            After the near-destruction of his XIXth Legion during the Drop Site
            Massacre on Isstvan V at the start of the Horus Heresy, Corax was
            desperate to rebuild his Legion. With the Emperor's permission, he
            and his Astartes delved deep beneath the Imperial Palace to recover
            the advanced genetic knowledge that the Emperor had used to create
            the primarchs.
          </p>
          <p>
            Corax then made use of these techniques and a recovered,
            undifferentiated primarch genetic template to accelerate the
            development of new Raven Guard Astartes. The repercussions of those
            actions came back to haunt him, leading Corax to eventually grant
            the Emperor's Peace to all the twisted, mutant spawn who emerged as
            the result of his experiments.
          </p>
          <p>
            In the wake of the Horus Heresy, Corax vanished into the Eye of
            Terror in search of penance for his shame. His current whereabouts
            and status remain unknown to the Raven Guard, their successors and
            the Imperium, yet their primarch remains alive within the
            Immaterium, though continuous exposure to the Warp has wrought
            multiple mutations upon him, revealing the truth of the being that
            lies beneath the facade of every primarch's Emperor-given flesh.
