            The Imperial Fists are one of the First Founding Chapters of the
            Space Marines and were originally the VII Legion of the Legiones
            Astartes raised by the Emperor Himself from across Terra during the
            Unification Wars.
          </p>
          <p>
            The Imperial Fists stand out from other Space Marine Chapters since
            they possess no fixed homeworld, although they are most frequently
            based on Terra. Instead, the Imperial Fists rely on their
            10,000-year-old mobile space fortress, Phalanx, to serve as their
            fortress-monastery.
          </p>
          <p>
            They maintain recruitment-chapels on various worlds spread
            throughout the Imperium. Part of the Imperial Fists' duties during
            the Great Crusade were to function as the Emperor's "personal
            praetorians," accompanying Him everywhere.
          </p>
          <p>
            The Imperial Fists were usually used to strike a decisive blow
            against the enemies He confronted during that time. The role of the
            Emperor's bodyguards since he was mortally wounded during the Horus
            Heresy and interred within the Golden Throne at the heart of the
            Imperial Palace on Terra has now been entirely taken over by the
            Adeptus Custodes. But the Emperor's ancient trust remains a potent
            honour for the Imperial Fists and their Successor Chapters in the
            present day.
          </p>
          <p>
            The Imperial Fists are the inheritors of the proud traditions of
            Primarch Rogal Dorn, his name venerated by countless trillions
            across the Imperium. History does not clearly record the details of
            the world on which the infant Dorn was cast when the primarchs were
            scattered to the corners of the galaxy. What is known is that he
            presented himself to the Emperor as the Great Crusade reached the
            Ice Hives of Inwit, offering one of the mightiest space-going
            vessels ever constructed by Humans during the Dark Age of Technology
            as a sign of his fealty.
          </p>
          <p>
            The Emperor welcomed His long-lost son into the ranks of the
            primarchs and granted him primacy over the Imperial Fists Legion.
            The Master of Mankind returned Dorn's vessel -- called Phalanx -- to
            the primarch, and it became the base from which Dorn, and sometimes
            the Emperor Himself, commanded some of the most glorious campaigns
            of the Great Crusade.
          </p>
          <p>
            Dorn and his Legion proved the masters of every aspect of warfare,
            but in particular the Imperial Fists excelled at siege craft,
            whether on the attack or the defence. This propelled them into a
            bitter rivalry with the Iron Warriors Legion and their jealous
            primarch Perturabo, the ï¬‚ames of which were wantonly fanned by
            Fulgrim, the primarch of the Emperor's Children Legion.
          </p>
          <p>
            Fulgrim is said to have asked Dorn if a fortification of his design
            could withstand an assault by the Iron Warriors, and Dorn is said to
            have answered that it could. Perturabo took the answer as a boastful
            sleight, and the seeds of a hatred that would only grow more bitter
            as the Terran millennia passed were sown.
          </p>
          <p>
            Loyalty in time of betrayal was not easy to measure, for one cannot
            look at the face of an ally and know if he is truly a friend or an
            enemy. Even after Horus' treachery was made manifest upon the plains
            of Isstvan III and the Drop Site Massacre of Isstvan V, the truth of
            who was Traitor and who remained loyal was far from clear.In this
            age of betrayal, one Legion stood as a pillar of loyalty amongst the
            sea of doubt. The Imperial Fists and Rogal Dorn, ever true, never
            swerving from the toll demanded by a war of brothers, bore the
            weight of loyalty without breaking, but not without cost. Sacrifice
            without limit changed those who survived.
          </p>

          </p>
          <p>
            As fate would have it, Dorn's prediction was put tragically to the
            test when, at the height of the Siege of Terra, the fortifications
            he had added to the Imperial Palace were sorely tested by the
            Traitor Legions. Though the World Eaters are said to have forced a
            breach, by sheer bloody savagery rather than any genuine skill at
            the siegemaster's craft, the Warmaster Horus fell in combat to the
            Emperor before the matter could be truly decided.
          </p>
          <p>
            It was only when the Imperial Fists and the Iron Warriors confronted
            one another in the hateful battle known as the "Iron Cage" in the
            days immediately after the Heresy during the campaigns of the Great
            Scouring that both were able to give full vent to their rivalry.
            Accounts of what took place within the Iron Cage differ, and to this
            day, both the Iron Warriors and the Imperial Fists claim to have
            come away from it the victor.
          </p>
          <p>
            Though Rogal Dorn was lost to the Imperium subsequent to the
            war-torn age of the Horus Heresy, his legacy remains one of the
            strongest of all of the primarchs. The Imperial Fists sired three
            Second Founding Successor Chapters -- the Imperial Fists themselves,
            the Crimson Fists and the Black Templars. Between them, these three
            Chapters hold as many battle honours as dozens of later created
            Adeptus Astartes formations, and their brethren have served with
            skill and distinction on countless thousands of battlefields across
            the galaxy.
          </p>
          <p>
            The Imperial Fists are one of the most valiant of all Chapters, held
            as paragons of the principles set down in the Codex Astartes and
            exemplars of everything to which a Space Marine is heir. The
            Imperial Fists stand as the steadfast defenders of the Imperium and
            the Emperor's unwavering shield; for ten thousand standard years
            they have been the bulwark against which the armies of Traitors and
            aliens have shattered.
          </p>
          <p>
            While Rogal Dorn is lost, Dorn's final moments were of courage and
            supreme sacrifice, and this example still drives the Imperial Fists
            onwards to fresh victories. Indeed, if the Imperial Fists have a
            fault, it is that they continue to strive when others would yield or
            withdraw. Such unquestioning steadfastness has rescued many a
            victory from the ashes of defeat, but only at a steep cost in lives.

            <h3>Rogal Dorn</h3>
            <img src="../../images/Primarch/IF Primarch.webp" alt="" />
          </div>
          <p>
            Rogal Dorn, known as "The Vigilant," the "Praetorian of Terra" and
            the "Unyielding One," and to his gene-sons by the "wall-name" of
            "Defiance," was the primarch of the Imperial Fists Space Marine
            Legion and one of the greatest heroes in the history of the Imperium
            of Man.
          </p>
          <p>
            A being of thunderous zeal and stone made manifest is how many
            described the primarch of the VIIth Legion. He had a stern and
            naturally unsmiling face, topped with an unruly shock of short,
            bone-white hair. His zeal was the fire of a son who believed in his
            father's dream for the Imperium without reservation and without
            question.
          </p>
          <p>
            To Rogal Dorn there was no higher purpose to the existence of the
            Legiones Astartes than the unification of Mankind, and the
            illumination of the Imperium's ideals. This idealism drove Dorn and
            his Legion ever onwards, never compromising, never stinting in any
            aspect of duty. The stone in his soul was his ability to bear
            whatever his father needed of him, an unyielding nature, which made
            him both a master of defence in war, and an indomitable aggressor on
            the attack.
          </p>
          <p>
            If the primarchs were the Emperor's nature split like white light
            through a prism's rays, as many Imperial scholars of the Imperial
            Court suggested during the Great Crusade, then from such a point of
            view, Rogal Dorn was the Emperor's implacable disciple in the
            pursuit of His cause given flesh; without compromise and in who
            loyalty and duty was as integral as blood and breath.
          </p>
          <p>
            It was perhaps for this reason, that even before the betrayal of
            Horus, the Emperor named Dorn the "Praetorian of Terra," and drew
            him to His side far away from the Warmaster and his newly-forged
            command. To some among his brother-primarchs, this served only to
            distance him and his Legion further from them, and those among them
            who had seen the sins of hubris and obstinacy in Dorn's undoubted
            stubbornness and pride, saw this aggrandisement as a further cause
            for discord and disquiet.
          </p>
          <p>
            It was Dorn who supervised the construction of the formidable
            defences of the Imperial Palace in the Himalazian (Himalayan)
            Mountains on Terra that would be sorely tested by the forces of
            Chaos during the epic climax of the Horus Heresy in the terrible
            Siege of Terra.
          </p>
          <p>
            And it was Dorn who would find the broken body of the Emperor upon
            the battleship Vengeful Spirit after His terrible final duel with
            Horus. Dorn placed the Emperor's broken body upon the Golden Throne,
            and received His last spoken instructions on how to shape the future
            of the war-devastated Imperium.
          </p>
          <p>
            Rogal Dorn allegedly died fighting aboard a Chaos Space Marine
            vessel in the late 31st Millennium, after attacking the 1st Black
            Crusade's warfleet with a vastly outnumbered Imperial force. Seeing
            the importance of attacking the enemy fleet while they were still
            preparing to invade Imperial space, he relied on hit-and-run attacks
            until his reinforcements could arrive.
          </p>
          <p>
            Dorn was believed slain on board the Chaos Despoiler-class
            Battleship Sword of Sacrilege after leading a desperate attack on
            its bridge, but in fact the Imperial Fists and their Successor
            Chapters believe that Dorn is still alive somewhere and may yet
            return when the Imperium needs him most.
