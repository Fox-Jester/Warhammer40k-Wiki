            The White Scars, who call themselves the "Horde of Jaghatai" and
            were originally called the Star Hunters during the early Great
            Crusade, are a Loyalist Space Marine Chapter and one of the First
            Founding Chapters of the Adeptus Astartes.
          </p>
          <p>
            Known and feared throughout the Imperium of Man for their highly
            mobile way of war, the White Scars are considered the masters of the
            lightning strike and hit-and-run attack and are particularly adapted
            to the use of the Astartes Assault Bike as their mechanical steeds
            and their forces contain an unusually large number of Bike Squads
            compared to other Chapters.
          </p>
          <p>
            Bearing the ritual scars of bravery, these fierce warriors fight
            with all the tribal savagery that define the fierce steppe nomads of
            their homeworld Mundus Planus, known to them as Chogoris, bringing
            swift death to all of the enemies of the Imperium.
          </p>
          <p>
            The fierce, honour-scarred battle-brothers of the White Scars
            Chapter are the inheritors of the Vth Space Marine Legion. Recruited
            from the most savage nomad tribes of the Feral World of Chogoris,
            the White Scars fight in the manner of the nomad warriors of the
            steppes.
          </p>
          <p>
            Mounting lightning assaults utilising the fastest of vehicles, the
            White Scars descend upon their foes in an unstoppable torrent, their
            hearts filled with savage joy and the battle cry "For the Emperor
            and the Khan!" on their lips.
          </p>
          <p>
            The primarch of the White Scars was the mighty Jaghatai Khan, the
            first and only warrior to have risen to such power that he could
            unite every one of the wild tribes of the Chogorian steppes into a
            single body. He achieved all this before the time when the Great
            Crusade reached Chogoris and the Primarch was re-united with his
            father.
          </p>
          <p>
            The young Jaghatai rose quickly to command the tribe that had
            adopted him, and by the strength of his rhetoric as well as his arm,
            he united the clans against their murderous city-dwelling oppressors
            of the Palatine empire. The steppes are said to have run red with
            blood as warriors united under Jaghatai's black horsehair banner and
            avenged every wrong ever done to them.
          </p>
          <p>
            The cities were destroyed and their armies set to the sword, until
            finally, all of Chogoris belonged to the tribes of the steppes. Mere
            solar months later, the Great Crusade reached Jaghatai's new-won
            kingdom, and upon setting eyes upon his father he knew that here was
            a man who shared his vision of human unity. Jaghatai understood that
            a far greater prize than any he could have imagined lay before him
            -- the reunification of the entirety of Mankind.
          </p>
          <p>
            The ranks of the Vth Legion were swelled by the intake of warriors
            inducted from Jaghatai Khan's fierce army, the Legion inheriting the
            traditions of the Chogorian steppes nomads. Soon, the savagery of
            the tribes had bred itself into the Legion's gene-seed too, but it
            was tempered by the fierce sense of honour and justice embodied so
            perfectly by the Legion's Primarch.
          </p>
          <p>
            The White Scars fought with valour and determination throughout the
            Great Crusade, though the years immediately preceding the Horus
            Heresy were spent mired in a campaign against an Ork Empire centred
            on the Chondax System.
          </p>
          <p>
            It was at the climax of this gruelling war that word arrived of the
            Warmaster Horus' treachery, and Rogal Dorn bade his brother Jaghatai
            to join with the Space Wolves of Leman Russ and return to Terra in
            preparation for the Traitors' assault.
          </p>
          <p>
            Anticipating such a move, the Warmaster despatched the Alpha Legion
            to engage the Space Wolves. Jaghatai was faced with the dilemma of
            aiding his brother Russ or answering Dorn's request.
          </p>
          <p>
            Forced to choose between his duty to his brother and duty to the
            Imperium, Jaghatai chose the latter, though the choice was far from
            easily made.
          </p>
          <p>
            The White Scars arrived at Terra in time to stand before the
            Traitors, though countless of their number gave their lives to
            thwart he who would undo the great work of the Master of Mankind.
          </p>
          <p>
            History recorded little of the Great Khan's actions during the Siege
            of Terra, but it is known that his Legion ranged the once-proud
            thoroughfares of Terra engaging the Traitors in punishing
            hit-and-run strikes, and that when the end finally came, the White
            Scars emerged from the fires of the galactic civil war bloodied, but
            alive.
          </p>
          <p>
            They must surely have been at the forefront of the Legions that
            pursued the defeated Traitors to the Eye of Terror during the Great
            Scouring that followed the Heresy, for to this day the White Scars
            rarely allow a defeated foe to slip away once their blood is up.

            <h3>Jaghatai Khan</h3>
            <img src="../../images/Primarch/WS Primarch.webp" alt="" />
          </div>
          <p>
            Jaghatai Khan (pronounced Jagg-a-tie KAAN), also known as "The Great
            Khan," "the Khagan" and "the Warhawk," was the primarch of the V
            Legion of Space Marines, the White Scars, who led them through the
            years of the Great Crusade and the Horus Heresy.
          </p>
          <p>
            Jaghatai fought alongside his White Scars for another 70 standard
            years following the end of the Heresy, eventually disappearing in
            084.M31 into a region of space known as the Maelstrom, a large Warp
            rift in the Ultima Segmentum that is a smaller counterpart of the
            Eye of Terror.
          </p>
          <p>
            Jaghatai is believed to have been in pursuit of the Drukhari who had
            savaged his homeworld of Chogoris following the Battle of Corusil V
            with his 1st Brotherhood when he went through a Warp Gate into the
            Drukhari portion of the Webway. Jaghatai had been in pursuit of a
            mighty Drukhari lord, likely the Archon of the Drukhari Kabal that
            had attacked Corusil V and perhaps even Chogoris itself.
          </p>
          <p>
            Jaghatai Khan has not been seen since, though the White Scars
            believe he is still alive somewhere within the Webway and will one
            day return to the Chapter in a time of great need. As a result of
            their primarch's disappearance, the White Scars hold a particularly
            savage grudge against the Drukhari and will gladly seek out any
            opportunity to make war upon those savage and terrifying xenos.
