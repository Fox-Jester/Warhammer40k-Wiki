            The Salamanders are one of the Loyalist First Founding Chapters of
            the Space Marines. They originally served as the Imperium's XVIIIth
            Space Marine Legion during the Great Crusade and the Horus Heresy.
            For some time before their unification with their primarch they were
            known as the "Dragon Warriors." Their homeworld is the volcanic
            Death World of Nocturne.
          </p>
          <p>
            The Salamanders are unusually concerned with civilian casualties
            compared to most other Chapters of the Adeptus Astartes and believe
            that one of their most important duties is to protect the lives of
            the Emperor of Mankind's innocent subjects whenever and wherever
            possible. This is an attitude that developed as a consequence of the
            Salamanders' own unusually close connections to the Nocturnean
            people, as they are one of the only Chapters of Astartes who
            continue to interact with their mortal families and the people of
            their homeworld after their transformation into Space Marines.
          </p>
          <p>
            For instance, it is not uncommon for a Salamander to live among the
            Nocturneans in special Chapter bastions created within each of their
            homeworld's seven tribal "Sanctuary Cities" when Chapter business
            does not require him to remain at the Chapter's fortress-monastery
            on Nocturne's moon of Prometheus, and certainly the Salamanders are
            looked upon as leaders within their communities. The Salamanders and
            their people as a whole are also defined by their adherence to a
            variation of the Imperial Cult called the Promethean Cult.
          </p>
          <p>
            The story of the Salamanders and the legend of how their Primarch
            Vulkan was reunited with the Emperor is one of the few stories from
            the time of the Great Crusade told in a coherent form across many
            different worlds of the Imperium. How much of this so-called
            Promethean Opus is factually accurate is unknown, and in many ways
            unimportant. The fact that the Salamanders have stood for ten
            thousand standard years as paragons of strength, honour and
            resolution is the true legacy of their primarch, and one that
            endures into the dark epoch of the 41st Millennium.
          </p>
          <p>
            The Salamanders hail from a world wracked by constant volcanic
            instability, but possessing the very rarest kinds of mineral
            resources. The violence of the cyclic volcanic activity creates and
            churns up strategic minerals highly prized by the Adeptus
            Mechanicus, yet the planet has been occupied by Mankind since long
            before the Age of the Imperium.
          </p>
          <p>
            When the infant Vulkan appeared on Nocturne, he was discovered by
            the smith of one of the seven main settlements, a master craftsman
            who soon taught the infant primarch all he knew. Within a few short
            Terran years Vulkan had developed into a hulk of a man, his mind as
            powerful as his body. Soon, Vulkan was teaching the master-smiths of
            Nocturne metalworking techniques lost to them since the darkest days
            of the Age of Strife. When Vulkan defeated one of the regular and
            highly costly Drukhari raids upon Nocturne, he was unanimously
            acknowledged as their leader.
          </p>
          <p>
            When the Emperor came to Nocturne to be reunited with His lost son,
            He chose not to do so with great ceremony as He had in several other
            cases, and He did not announce His identity, hiding behind an
            obscuring psychic glamour. Instead, He came as a stranger during the
            festival to celebrate Vulkan's great victory. By tradition, such
            celebrations included numerous contests and trials of strength, and
            so the stranger challenged Vulkan, declaring that the winner of
            their contest would kneel before the other and declare his eternal
            fealty.
          </p>
          <p>
            The resulting challenge saw the stranger and the primarch perform
            such deeds that no mortal could replicate, culminating in a hunt to
            slay the largest of the great, fire-loving, native Nocturnean
            reptiles known as "salamanders" and return to the settlement with
            its body. During this final challenge, Vulkan slew a gargantuan
            beast, but upon his return journey the ground opened up beneath him
            and a torrent of lava surged up to engulf him.
          </p>
          <p>
            With one hand clinging to a rock and the other gripping the tail of
            his huge prize, Vulkan hung perilously over the surging lava, his
            mighty strength seeping away after the many solar days of trials.
            Only by abandoning his trophy could Vulkan save himself, yet he
            refused to do so, even in the face of death.
          </p>
          <p>
            Then, the stranger appeared before him, but His path was blocked by
            yet another lava channel. Vulkan saw that the stranger dragged
            behind him a prize even greater than his own, the body of the
            largest salamander ever seen, which he cast into the lava to form a
            bridge. A moment later, the stranger took Vulkan's hand and lifted
            the primarch and his prize straight up, saving him from death. Upon
            their return to the settlement the elders declared Vulkan the winner
            of the contest, for the stranger had returned from the hunt
            empty-handed.
          </p>
          <p>
            But it was not the stranger who declared his eternal fealty, but the
            primarch who did so, going down on one knee and declaring that a man
            who valued another's life over his own victory was a man worth
            serving. In that moment, the stranger cast off His psychic disguise
            and all could see Him for what He truly was, the Master of Mankind
            in all His glory, come to Nocturne to find His son and to reunite
            its people with the rest of Humanity.
          </p>
          <p>
            Vulkan assumed the mantle of primarch of the XVIIIth Legion,
            thereafter called the Salamanders in honour of their new Legion
            homeworld and the contest that had reunited them with their
            gene-father. Recruiting from the hardy men of Nocturne, the
            Salamanders Legion soon became known for the strength, courage, and
            honour of its battle-brothers, as well as the skills with which they
            fashioned their weapons of war.
          </p>
          <p>
            But the age of Imperial glory was not to last long, for along with
            the Iron Hands and the Raven Guard, the Salamanders were deceived by
            the Warmaster Horus into taking their place amongst the doomed first
            wave of Loyalist Space Marine Legions at the Drop Site Massacre of
            Isstvan V, where they were decimated first by the Traitors' defences
            and then by the treachery of those Legions forming the second wave.
            The Salamanders are known to have suffered tragic losses at Isstvan
            V as one of the so-called "Shattered Legions," though sufficient
            numbers escaped to save the Legion from extinction.
          </p>
          <p>
            Records of this age are incomplete at best, and little of the
            Salamanders' actions or the deeds of their primarch are preserved.
            The events immediately following the galactic civil war are even
            more obscured and perhaps known only to the taciturn masters of the
            Salamanders' Librarius. The XVIIIth Legion appears to have sired no
            immediate successors, and it is likely that their numbers were so
            depleted by the events of the Isstvan V Drop Site Massacre that it
            was not possible to divide it into separate Chapters during the
            Second Founding. Several Chapters created much later in subsequent
            Foundings may share the genetic inheritance of the Salamanders, but
            no evidence exists of any Second Founding Successor Chapters having
            been sired.
          </p>
          <p>
            The extent to which the dictates of the Codex Astartes were adhered
            to in the aftermath of the break-up of the old Legions varied much,
            and the Salamanders appear to have obeyed it in some respects, while
            ignoring it in others. The fielding of only seven, over-strength
            companies by the Chapter in the 41st Millennium is one example of
            this, though in other respects the Chapter is largely compliant with
            Roboute Guilliman's tome.
          </p>
          <p>
            The ultimate fate of the Salamanders' primarch is a matter of much
            conjecture, for he disappeared many standard years after the end of
            the Horus Heresy. Some sources state that Vulkan led his Chapter for
            three entire standard millennia before he departed on some mission
            he never declared to the Imperium at large, though scant evidence of
            any of his deeds throughout that age remain. The tale is made all
            the more mysterious by the fact that Vulkan appeared to have left
            behind him a collection of sacred texts and other objects,
            collectively called the Tome of Fire, within which is locked the
            nature and location of nine potent technological artefacts made by
            his own hand that the primarch willed to his Chapter.
          </p>
          <p>
            According to Chapter belief, only when all nine of these "Artefacts
            of Vulkan" are recovered, as five now have been, will Vulkan judge
            the Salamanders sufficiently tempered to have passed the ultimate
            contest. Then, so the legend states, he shall return to lead the
            Salamanders in the final war against the enemies of Humanity.

          </div>
          <p>
            Vulkan was one of the 20 superhuman primarchs and a Perpetual
            created by the Emperor of Mankind from altered versions of His own
            DNA to lead His Great Crusade and reunite the scattered peoples of
            Humanity within the Imperium of Man.
          </p>
          <p>
            The XVIIIth Legion, created from Vulkan's genome and originally
            known as the Dragon Warriors, was re-named the Salamanders after the
            great fire-resistant reptiles native to his volcanic homeworld of
            Nocturne in memory of the legendary contest between the Emperor and
            Vulkan in 832.M30 that had involved slaying one of those dangerous
            beasts. The outcome of this contest had revealed the Emperor's
            identity to Vulkan and restored the primarch to the Imperium.
          </p>
          <p>
            Like his genetic father, Vulkan was a Perpetual, a rare Human mutant
            blessed with extraordinary, almost supernatural cellular
            regeneration that allowed him to be resurrected from death over and
            over no matter how much damage his body suffered. Vulkan was able to
            regenerate fully from any injury, including a death that resulted in
            his complete molecular disintegration. This ability was unknown to
            him until the Horus Heresy and his near-death from an orbital atomic
            strike unleashed by the Iron Warriors' fleet at the Drop Site
            Massacre on Isstvan V.
          </p>
          <p>
            During the Great Crusade Vulkan gained a reputation among its
            participants for his unusual empathy for a primarch towards average
            Humans as well as his extraordinary ability to craft unique and
            powerful items of advanced technology.
          </p>
          <p>
            Approximately a thousand standard years after the Horus Heresy,
            Vulkan hid 9 sacred artefacts he had created around the galaxy for
            the Salamanders to find, intended as a test to see if they were
            worthy of his leadership.
          </p>
          <p>
            He then disappeared, leaving his genetic sons with the message that
            whenever the Forgefather of the Salamanders had found all nine
            items, Vulkan would return to lead his Chapter to victory over the
            enemies of the Imperium in its final days of greatest need,
            according to the signs foreseen in the Promethean Cult's book of
            prophecy, the Tome of Fire.
