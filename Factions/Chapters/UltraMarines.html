            The Ultramarines are considered one of the strongest and most
            honoured of all the Space Marine Chapters in the Imperium of Man,
            and were responsible for almost single-handedly holding the Imperium
            together after the Horus Heresy.
          </p>
          <p>
            Highly-disciplined and courageous warriors, the Ultramarines have
            remained true to the teachings of Primarch Roboute Guilliman for
            10,000 standard years. The Ultramarines were originally the XIIIth
            Space Marine Legion before the reforms that initiated the Second
            Founding and reshaped the Imperium after the Heresy in the Time of
            Rebirth on the orders of Guilliman himself as the lord commander of
            the Imperium and Imperial Regent.
          </p>
          <p>
            The name "Ultramarines" is a nod to the Chapter's galactic region of
            origin, its standing amongst the other Space Marine Chapters and
            their role as the source for the gene-seed of more Chapters of the
            Adeptus Astartes than any of the other former First Founding Legions
            combined.
          </p>
          <p>
            The culture of the Ultramarines is loosely themed upon the culture
            of Old Earth's ancient Roman Empire, as exemplified in their
            Astartes' High Gothic names and their strict adherence to the Codex
            Astartes, as well as the society of their homeworld of Macragge and
            the Chapter's method of recruitment.
          </p>
          <p>
            The Ultramarines directly rule the sub-sector of space in the
            Segmentum Ultima of the galactic east known as Ultramar as a fief of
            the Imperium and their Chapter Master is also considered the Lord of
            Macragge and the Master of Ultramar.
          </p>
          <p>
            Of all the thousand and more Space Marine Chapters in the Imperium,
            it is the blue-clad Ultramarines that, in the mind of the countless
            billions of the Emperor's subjects, personify everything that the
            Adeptus Astartes stands for. The Ultramarines and their many
            Successor Chapters have stood at the very forefront of the war
            against the Traitor, the alien, and the Daemon since the very
            foundation of the Imperium. Across the domains of the Emperor, the
            Ultramarines are celebrated as heroic, virtuous, and noble defenders
            of Humanity, their deeds recorded in devotional works the length and
            breadth of the galaxy.
          </p>
          <p>
            Even amongst the Space Marine Chapters themselves, the Ultramarines
            occupy a position of special honour. The gene-seed from which the
            original Ultramarines Legion was founded is considered the purest
            that remains, and it is estimated that some two-thirds of Chapters
            across the galaxy share their inheritance, being either direct
            successors or created from tithed Ultramarines genetic material.
            This shared inheritance often ensures that when the Ultramarines go
            to war, they are supported by many other Chapters, and that when
            Space Marine commanders gather to consider common strategy, the
            counsel of the Ultramarines is greatly valued.
          </p>
          <p>
            Often, the presence of even a small number of Ultramarines units in
            a larger military undertaking will ensure the participation of many
            more Chapters, so highly are the sons of Roboute Guilliman held in
            their brothers' esteem.
          </p>
          <p>
            When Hive Fleet Behemoth struck the Eastern Fringe, it was the
            Ultramarines Chapter that turned the tide, even at the cost of the
            Chapter's entire Veteran 1st Company. At the Chapter homeworld of
            Macragge, one of the largest battles seen in centuries was fought,
            with the Ultramarines, led by their master Marneus Calgar, at the
            very forefront. In addition to the great honour won by the Chapter
            in that titanic struggle, the Ultramarines gained invaluable
            experience in fighting these vile xenos, which they have passed on,
            often via service in the Deathwatch, to many other Chapters.
          </p>
          <p>
            When the Horus Heresy erupted, the Ultramarines were long prevented
            from defending the Throneworld by the great Ruinstorm conjured by
            the Word Bearers during the Battle of Calth that cut the galaxy in
            half for long years. By the time the Ruinstorm dissipated and the
            Ultramarines could move to reinforce Terra, the Warmaster Horus'
            Siege of Terra was already underway.
          </p>
          <p>
            Nevertheless, the Ultramarines fought their way towards Terra, and
            although they defeated a massive Traitor space ï¬‚eet, were unable to
            reach the Sol System in time to intervene in the final battle. It is
            Guilliman's actions subsequent to the Horus Heresy that made him the
            figure of adoration that he would become. With the Traitors
            scattered and the Emperor to all intents and purposes lost to
            Humanity, the Imperium stood at the precipice.>
          </p>
          <p>
            It was the genius and leadership of Roboute Guilliman that saw the
            Imperium through its first standard century after the Heresy, as he
            kept invaders at bay and saved the scattered Human worlds from
            collapsing into anarchy, reforming the Imperial bureaucracy and
            armed forces as needed.
          </p>
          <p>
            Roboute Guilliman fell at the hands of his erstwhile brother, the
            Daemon Primarch Fulgrim of the Emperor's Children Traitor Legion, at
            the Battle of Thessala in 121.M31. Poisoned unto death, Guilliman's
            barely living body was placed in a stasis field, and later enthroned
            in the Ultramarines' fortress-monastery. There it remained for ten
            thousand standard years, until he was resurrected by a combination
            of Imperial science and Aeldari mysticism during the 13th Black
            Crusade in ca. 999.M41. He would take up the mantle of the lord
            commander of the Imperium and the Imperial Regent once more, and now
            leads the defence of Mankind from the darkness brought by the birth
            of the Great Rift at the dawn of the Era Indomitus.
          </p>
          <p>
            The Ultramarines are by far the best known and most celebrated
            Adeptus Astartes Chapter in the long and bloody history of the
            Imperium of Man. Statues of their primarch and their greatest heroes
            rear high above countless plazas and city gates, and images of their
            myriad victories glow from stained glass windows in the mightiest
            basilicas imperialis.
          </p>
          <p>
            The Ultramarines Legion was the largest of those bodies raised to
            prosecute the Great Crusade so long ago, and as a result it provided
            the largest number of Chapters when the Second Founding occurred in
            the aftermath of the Horus Heresy. In addition, the Chapter's
            gene-seed is generally held to be the purest of all the Adeptus
            Astartes, and it is so stable that even 10,000 standard years after
            its inception, mutation is well within tolerable limits. For this
            reason, a majority of Space Marines Chapters extant in the 41st
            Millennium are thought to be related to the Ultramarines, whether
            either is aware of it or not, and as such, inheritors of all that
            made that Legion so great.
          </p>
          <p>
            The Ultramarines Chapter is at once the exemplar of everything a
            Space Marine aspires to, and the template by which he acts, fights
            and worships. Every Chapter has its own traditions, histories and
            battle-honours, but the Ultramarines are the standard by which many
            others, especially those of their genetic lineage, judge themselves
            and their peers, whether they acknowledge it or not.
          </p>
          <p>
            It is through the dictates of the Codex Astartes that the 10,000
            Terran years of wisdom and expertise gleaned by the Ultramarines are
            enshrined. This vast reserve of lore was authored by the
            Ultramarines primarch, Roboute Guilliman himself, wherein he laid
            the foundations of the Imperium's reformation during the Time of
            Rebirth in the aftermath of the calamitous wars of the Horus Heresy.
            Guilliman was a leader of prodigious intellect, and not just in the
            military fields. With the Imperium brought to its knees by galactic
            civil war, he turned his mind to uniting and codifying the highest
            echelons of the Imperium's government, imposing order on
            institutions that had been split asunder by the anarchy of the
            Heresy. Only a primarch, a gene-son of the Emperor Himself, could
            have conceived such an undertaking, for the scattered Imperial
            worlds that had survived the Heresy were on their knees, riven with
            plague and famine and rife for rebellion or invasion.
          </p>
          <p>
            The task was gargantuan, and no mere mortal man could have faced it
            without going mad. Guilliman offered leadership and hope, and he
            became a figurehead for the reborn Imperium. Countless billions came
            to know his name, and while he could never replace their beloved
            Emperor, Guilliman was a firm hand when it was needed most, and the
            Imperium endured.
          </p>
          <p>
            In committing his wisdom to the first volumes of the Codex Astartes,
            Guilliman must have known that he would not see his most cherished
            ambitions fulfilled. After all, none had ever imagined that a
            primarch might know death, but the Horus Heresy had seen several
            slain or otherwise lost, and in the years that followed more would
            suffer similar fates.
          </p>
          <p>
            When Guilliman was lost to the Imperium, he left behind him
            countless works of wisdom and insight, and the greatest of these was
            the Codex Astartes. Though the Imperium would again rise to heights
            rivalling those of the Great Crusade, and descend to depths of
            despair as dark as the Horus Heresy, Roboute Guilliman's wisdom
            would prevail.
          </p>
          <p>
            The Ultramarines were and are the guardians of that wisdom, and the
            exemplars of all their primarch embodied. The Codex Astartes has
            become a sacred text for them, a blueprint describing the ideals by
            which the majority of Chapters organise themselves, fight, recruit,
            train and operate.
          </p>
          <p>
            The Ultramarines rule over a region of space called Ultramar, an
            autonomous realm that owes no tithes to the Imperium and looks
            entirely to its own defence. The peoples of the various worlds of
            Ultramar look to the Ultramarines as both beneficent rulers and as
            distant figures of legend. While the vast majority of Humanity will
            never even see a Space Marine, let alone speak to one, the people of
            Ultramar are more familiar with these mighty warriors. Some even
            have the honour of being distantly related to one, perhaps some
            distant ancestor having been accepted into the Chapter. The
            Ultramarines regard it as their sacred duty to rule their domains
            justly, and to protect them as the source of their recruiting and
            resources. In this the Ultramarines are continuing the legacy of
            their primarch, whose teachings each warrior studies and memorises
            over the course of his service.
          </p>
          <p>
            The Codex Astartes is such a vast body of wisdom that even the
            prodigious, genetically-enhanced mental capacity of a Space Marine
            is taxed with absorbing it all. Yet the Ultramarines regard it as
            their duty to do so, and choose to eschew the blunt tool of
            psycho-conditioning in favour of learning every passage by
            remorseless study.
          </p>
          <p>
            Each battle-brother absorbs and analyses entire chapters of the
            Codex, so that after several standard centuries of service he is at
            once a master and a scholar of his chosen area of expertise. Within
            a company, especially a low-numbered one consisting of numerous
            long-service Veterans, it is likely that the entire Codex Astartes
            will be known by the battle-brothers, allowing its commanding
            captain to draw upon an enormous pool of wisdom as well as
            experience. A Veteran Ultramarines battle-brother is therefore a
            deeply learned individual, schooled in every nuance of the arts of
            war and the wisdom of his primarch.

            <h3>Roboute Guilliman</h3>
            <img src="../../images/Primarch/UM Primarch.webp" alt="" />
          </div>
          <p>
            Roboute Guilliman (pronounced Ruh-BOOT-ay GIL-li-man), sometimes
            referred to as the "Avenging Son," "The Victorious," "The Master of
            Ultramar" and "The Blade of Unity," is the primarch of the
            Ultramarines Space Marine Legion and its myriad subsequent Successor
            Chapters. He is the current lord commander of the Imperium and the
            ruling Imperial Regent.
          </p>
          <p>
            Held by some as a paragon among the Emperor's sons, Roboute
            Guilliman was as much a patrician statesman and empire-builder as he
            was an indefatigable warrior.
          </p>
          <p>
            A being of preternatural intelligence, cold reason and indomitable
            will, Guilliman forged his XIIIth Legion into a vast force of
            conquest and control, a weapon by which he made himself the master
            of a stellar domain in the Eastern Fringe of the galaxy, the Realm
            of Ultramar, which during his lifetime spanned five hundred worlds.
          </p>
          <p>
            Before He began His conquest of the galaxy, the Emperor of Mankind
            created the primarchs. Utilising incredible skills at genetic
            engineering, and the phenomenal psychic power bound into His own
            form, He forged twenty demigod sons. These were superlative
            transhuman warriors, strategists and leaders, the finest qualities
            of Humanity refined in the crucible of science and magnified through
            the lens of divinity.
          </p>
          <p>
            The Emperor intended the primarchs to stand at His side during the
            Great Crusade, each leading one of the twenty Space Marine Legions
            to glory beyond imagination.
          </p>
          <p>
            Before that plan could come to pass, the Dark Gods of Chaos
            intervened. They snatched up the nascent primarchs and scattered
            them through the Warp, so that each came to rest upon a different
            one of Humanity's far-flung worlds. Some say that it was at this
            time that the Ruinous Powers left their mark upon the Emperor's
            gene-sons, and that this is why fully half of the primarchs betrayed
            their father and the Imperium during the Horus Heresy.
          </p>
          <p>
            Whatever the case, Roboute Guilliman was not tainted in such a
            fashion. The being that would become the primarch of the
            Ultramarines Legion came to rest upon the world of Macragge. There
            he was discovered, and adopted, by a local warlord named Konor.
            Growing and developing at a superhuman rate, Konor's adoptive son
            soon surpassed all those around him, and came to be the greatest
            warrior, strategist and statesman upon Macragge.
          </p>
          <p>
            After Konor was slain by a treacherous ally, it was Guilliman who
            avenged his foster father, before taking upon himself the mantle of
            kingship. The entirety of Macragge was swiftly unified beneath the
            banner of Roboute Guilliman, becoming a world of peace,
            civilisation, wisdom and strength.
          </p>
          <p>
            Guilliman was a charismatic and gifted leader, beloved of his people
            and singularly capable of compartmentalising incredible quantities
            of information. He was an organiser, a logistician, one capable of
            turning the wildest theories into practical reality and rendering
            order from chaos.
          </p>
          <p>
            When the Emperor's crusading forces finally reached Macragge in the
            late 30th Millennium, the son was reunited with his true father.
            Guilliman was given charge of the Ultramarines Legion, and wasted no
            time in putting his stamp upon it. In the conquests that followed,
            the Ultramarines became renowned as exemplars of what it meant to be
            a Space Marine.
          </p>
          <p>
            Under Guilliman's leadership they became arguably the most
            strategically gifted and tactically balanced of all the Legiones
            Astartes. Working on the basis of theoretical situations and
            practical solutions, the Ultramarines fought with exceptional
            efficiency. They drove the foes of Humanity before them, their
            armies fighting like intricate and perfectly tuned machines to
            swiftly and decisively outmanoeuvre every foe.
          </p>
          <p>
            When the Horus Heresy set the galaxy ablaze, Roboute Guilliman
            fought with loyalty and determination for the Imperium that he
            believed in with all his heart. When he thought that the Emperor had
            fallen, the primarch established a new seat of power on Macragge,
            planning to preserve the Emperor's secular purity and Imperial Truth
            within his own Realm of Ultramar as the Imperium Secundus.
          </p>
          <p>
            When Guilliman later learned that Terra still stood, he did
            everything in his power to ensure that he and his loyal brothers
            could fight at their father's side in the final battle against
            Horus. Though his efforts benefitted many, Guilliman himself reached
            Terra too late, a fact that would torture him for solar decades to
            come.
          </p>
          <p>
            In the wake of the Horus Heresy, it was the Ultramarines primarch
            who wrote and instituted the Codex Astartes, a key volume that laid
            out the proper tactics and military organisation for the majority of
            Loyalist Space Marine Chapters now in existence.
          </p>
          <p>
            Guilliman is the primarch who took up the Emperor's burning blade
            and became the lord commander of the Imperium and the Imperial
            Regent, serving amongst the High Lords of Terra during the period of
            the reformation and reconstruction of the Imperium's administrative
            and military structure called the Time of Rebirth. Guilliman
            single-handedly reshaped the Imperium after the Horus Heresy, taking
            the lead role in reforming its bureaucratic and military apparatus
            following the internment of the Emperor of Mankind within the Golden
            Throne on Terra.
          </p>
          <p>
            Roboute Guilliman is also one of the few Loyalist primarchs still
            alive. Following the Great Scouring, Guilliman and his Ultramarines
            met the Emperor's Children Traitor Legion at the Battle of Thessala
            in 121.M31, where his corrupt brother Fulgrim mortally wounded him
            with a slice to the neck made by that Daemon Primarch's
            Chaos-tainted blades.
          </p>
          <p>
            So it was that the dying Roboute Guilliman was put into temporal
            stasis on the verge of death and his body placed upon the throne
            that lay in the Temple of Correction on the Ultramarines' homeworld
            of Macragge. For the last ten millenia many pilgrims of the Imperial
            Cult travelled across the galaxy every standard year to visit the
            temple and see the body of a primarch, a blessed son of the
            God-Emperor Himself.
          </p>
          <p>
            Some pilgrims claimed that the grievous wound was slowly healing,
            though such an action was physically impossible within an activated
            stasis field. The Avenging Son was silently enthroned through the
            millennia as his father's Imperium decayed around him, waiting until
            such a time when one could come with the power to restore him. And
            that time has come.
          </p>
          <p>
            The primarch was resurrected during the Ultramar Campaign of the
            13th Black Crusade in 999.M41 by the technical prowess of Archmagos
            Dominus Belisarius Cawl and the power of the Aeldari god of the dead
            Ynnead through his priestess Yvraine.
          </p>
          <p>
            Soon after, Guilliman launched the Terran Crusade from Macragge
            through the growing Warp instability of the galaxy as the power of
            Chaos waxed mighty once more with the birth of the Great Rift. After
            nearly being imprisoned for eternity in the Maelstrom and then
            almost slain by his brother the Daemon Primarch Magnus the Red on
            Luna, Guilliman finally arrived at Holy Terra.
          </p>
          <p>
            There, he entered the inner sanctum of the Imperial Palace and met
            with his father the Emperor for the first time in more than ten
            thousand standard years. What passed between father and son at that
            meeting is not known, but when he emerged, Guilliman announced that
            he was once more assuming the mantles of the lord commander of the
            Imperium and Imperial Regent, the first among equals on the
            Senatorum Imperialis and the de facto ruler of the Imperium.
          </p>
          <p>
            As the Great Rift's cataclysmic birth following the fall of Cadia
            disrupted interstellar travel and communications and the Noctis
            Aeterna closed like a shroud upon the galaxy, Guilliman moved
            swiftly to stabilise the faltering Imperium. He turned to Belisarius
            Cawl once more to complete a plan that had been over 10,000 standard
            years in the making, since the end of the Horus Heresy and
            Guilliman's last tenure as the Imperium's lord commander.
          </p>
          <p>
            Cawl had spent that time "perfecting" the Emperor's original genetic
            template for the Space Marines laid down before the Great Crusade,
            creating a new legion of hundreds of thousands of improved Astartes
            deep beneath the surface of his forge on Mars. This new breed of
            transhuman warrior, the Primaris Space Marines, were bigger, more
            physically powerful and possessed faster reaction times than their
            original Astartes counterparts.
          </p>
          <p>
            Cawl had also spent the intervening millennia pushing the very
            boundaries of Adeptus Mechanicus dogma in search of "innovation,"
            creating new, more advanced power armour, wargear, and vehicles for
            the Primaris Marines.
          </p>
          <p>
            But before Guilliman could move to make use of his new armies, the
            Chaos God Khorne took advantage of the Noctis Aeterna to launch a
            daemonic assault upon the Throneworld of Mankind, initiating the
            Battle of Lion's Gate.
          </p>
          <p>
            Though Guilliman led the Imperial defenders, including the Sisters
            of Silence and the Adeptus Custodes, in throwing back the howling
            servants of the Blood God, the brazen assault shocked the High Lords
            of Terra to the core. They realised that in this new age, no world
            was safe from the Ruinous Powers and the other foes of Mankind.
          </p>
          <p>
            In the wake of the Battle of Lion's Gate, Guilliman gathered the
            greatest fleet of Imperial warriors that had been seen since the
            Great Crusade. The largest component of this force included a
            massive new host of hundreds of thousands of Primaris Space Marines,
            divided half into new Chapters of the Adeptus Astartes and half into
            9 Space Marine Legion-sized formations known as the Unnumbered Sons.
          </p>
          <p>
            The primarch launched this massive Indomitus Crusade out into the
            void, determined to throw back the forces of Chaos and the xenos
            hordes wherever they threatened the worlds of humanity. Guilliman
            set a winding course. Strike forces from over a dozen pre-existing
            Chapters of Space Marines, led by the Imperial Fists, also joined
            the fleet. Thus began many new legends as Guilliman travelled to aid
            beleaguered planets, breaking sieges and sweeping away Chaos and
            xenos invaders alike to bring hope back to the desperate defenders.
          </p>
          <p>
            The Indomitus Crusade would reach the end of its first major phase
            approximately twelve standard years later at the Battle of Raukos.
            Afterwards, Guilliman would turn his attention to helping his Realm
            of Ultramar defeat the forces of the Death Guard Traitor Legion and
            the servants of Nurgle in the Plague Wars, driving his traitorous
            brother Mortarion and the Death Guard from the region in ca.
            012.M42.
          </p>
          <p>
            Before the conflict had ended, Guilliman announced that he had made
            a grave mistake when he had allowed the official borders of Ultramar
            to shrink so drastically in the days after the Horus Heresy.
          </p>
          <p>
            Instead, he reestablished the ancient ruling Tetrarch Council for
            Ultramar, and tasked its newly-appointed Tetrarchs, including his
            Primaris Space Marine Equerry Captain Decimus Felix and the
            Ultramarines First Captain Severus Agemman, with beginning to expand
            the territories of Ultramar to include all of the star systems that
            had once comprised the Five Hundred Worlds.
