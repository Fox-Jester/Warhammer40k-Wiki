            The Space Wolves, known in their own dialect of Juvjk as the Vlka
            Fenryka or "Wolves of Fenris," are one of the original 20 First
            Founding Space Marine Chapters, and were once led by their famed
            primarch, Leman Russ. Originally the VIth Legion of Astartes raised
            by the Emperor at the dawn of the Great Crusade, the Space Wolves
            are renowned for their anti-authoritarian ways and their embrace of
            their homeworld Fenris' savage barbarian culture as well as their
            extreme deviation from the Codex Astartes in the Chapter's
            organisation.
          </p>
          <p>
            After the Horus Heresy and the resultant Second Founding reforms of
            the Adeptus Astartes, the Space Wolves Legion was divided into two
            Chapters: the new Space Wolves Chapter, which was not compliant with
            the dictates of the Codex Astartes and retained the name of its
            parent Space Marine Legion, and the second Chapter which took the
            name of the Wolf Brothers. The Wolf Brothers suffered from rampant
            mutation of their gene-seed not long after their Founding and were
            later disbanded.
          </p>
          <p>
            Only recently in the Era Indomitus have new successors of the Space
            Wolves been raised; though many Space Wolves still have doubts about
            whether the Primaris Marines raised from the genetic material of
            Leman Russ are true sons of the primarch, the Great Wolf Logan
            Grimnar has accepted them into the fold as warriors worthy of the
            Wolf King's heritage.
          </p>
          <p>
            Since the Imperium came into being, the Space Wolves have fought
            tooth and nail for the cause of the Emperor. Amongst the most famous
            of the Chapters of the Adeptus Astartes in the wider Imperium, their
            sagas are told from one end of the galaxy to the other. As
            headstrong as they are fierce, the Space Wolves excel at
            close-quarters fighting, their warriors vying keenly for glory on
            the field of battle. The Space Wolves live to fight, and death holds
            even less fear for them than their counterparts in other Chapters.
          </p>
          <p>
            The legends of the Space Wolves Chapter are told on countless
            thousands of worlds, and like the greatest of their fellow First
            Founding kin, they hold so many battle-honours that it would take a
            battle-scribe an entire lifetime to commit them all to parchment.
            The manner in which such laurels are won and recounted amongst the
            Space Wolves is very different to how such things are achieved
            amongst other Chapters.
          </p>
          <p>
            The Space Wolves are savage and proud, and they seek glory in all
            they do. Some, especially the Dark Angels, regard the Sons of Russ
            as braggarts and gloryhounds, finding their methods crude and their
            desire to make a name for themselves vainglorious. In truth, every
            Space Wolves battle-brother longs for his story -- his saga -- to be
            recounted by his kin long after he has fallen, and for his name to
            be spoken in the same breath as the primarch himself.
          </p>
          <p>
            The Space Wolves deviate from the Codex Astartes and the essential
            nature of what it is to be a Space Marine about as far as is
            possible. Their genetic inheritance is at once a blessing and a
            curse, for although each Space Wolf is gifted of the transhuman
            senses of Russ himself, their enhanced physiologies can be overcome
            by the change and a dramatic and terrible mutation can manifest.
          </p>
          <p>
            In organisation, the Chapter has never paid any regard to the
            dictates of Roboute Guilliman's Codex Astartes, stubbornly cleaving
            to the structure that saw it through the wars at the very dawn of
            the Age of the Imperium. In appearance, the Space Wolves are savage
            and wild, adorning their armour with a combination of finely-wrought
            talismans and skins, bones, and teeth taken as trophies from beasts
            they have slain in single combat. Even in their manners, the
            battle-brothers of the Space Wolves differ from most other Space
            Marines, for they are competitive and headstrong, and at once
            individualistic and fiercely loyal to their squad or "pack."
          </p>
          <p>
            Space Wolves seek to write their saga with every deed they perform
            and every battle they fight, and perhaps more than any other
            Chapter, their service is an epic in itself. The rites of initiation
            that a Space Wolf must undergo in order to be accepted as a neophyte
            are amongst the most harsh of any Chapter. Often he must actually
            fall in combat having slain all of his foes first, a guttering spark
            of life remaining.
          </p>
          <p>
            His deeds witnessed by a so-called "Chooser of the Slain," the young
            warrior awakens far from his tribe. But this is only the beginning,
            for so potent is the gene-stock of Leman Russ that most who receive
            it are overcome, their bodies ravaged by mutation as they transform
            into savage, once-Human beasts called Wulfen.
          </p>
          <p>
            Those who can contain this animal potency are judged fit to proceed,
            and after countless more trials may be accepted into the ranks of
            the Blood Claw Assault Packs. At this stage in his life, a Space
            Wolf is likely to be a headstrong berserker competing with his peers
            for the approval of his superiors. He is also full of the disdain
            and reckless overconfidence of youth, convinced that his methods are
            correct and the older warriors are simply stuck in their ways. Only
            as he matures with experience, faces more foes and suffers the
            cathartic tragedy of losing beloved battle-brothers of his pack does
            he change, and progress to join the Veteran Grey Hunter packs.
          </p>
          <p>
            Later in life, having faced every foe and seen all there is to be
            seen, the Space Wolf and his few surviving peers might form a Long
            Fangs pack, where their hard-fought experience and wisdom affords
            them the ability to provide fire support to the rest of the force,
            and to act as an immovable island in the seething ocean of battle.
            Throughout his service, the Space Wolf compiles his great saga, not
            in words, but in deeds. He seeks out the most powerful of enemies
            and faces the most arduous of tasks.
          </p>
          <p>
            Every Adeptus Astartes Chapter is a cadre of heroes, and the Space
            Wolves even more so than most, so to earn a special place in the
            annals of his Chapter, a Space Wolf must perform truly epic deeds
            and face such foes as would give even the mightiest of figures
            pause. As a result of these deeds, each Space Wolf carries within
            him unparalleled expertise, and wears the scars to prove it.
          </p>
          <p>
            Perhaps more than any other Chapter, the character of a Space Wolves
            battle-brother is defined by his age. Perhaps the changes wrought
            within him by the Canis Helix grant him something of the essence of
            his primarch, a potent and savage nature the battle-brother must
            struggle to control. Leman Russ was known as a being of wild humours
            and often contradictory drives. One moment he was jovial, the next
            sullen. At the conclusion of one battle he might have ordered
            clemency and mercy, and at another brooked no quarter.
          </p>
          <p>
            To the Space Wolves, there is no contradiction, for the very world
            that birthed them, Fenris, is subject to such extremes. One season
            the land of ice and fire is cold and snow-swept, the next the skies
            blacken with ash and lava ﬂows dissect the plains. Thus, the nature
            and character of a Space Wolf depends very much upon his stage in
            life. The youngest are headstrong and cocksure, seemingly determined
            to get themselves killed charging headlong into battle.
          </p>
          <p>
            The Grey Hunters are more mature, knowing the constraints of their
            abilities but confident of their skills. The Long Fangs are the
            oldest and the wisest, affably disapproving of the antics of the
            youngsters but ever ready with words of advice. The most skilled in
            battle and leadership of whatever age serve as Wolf Guard, the
            guardians of the Chapter's mightiest heroes. Whatever his station, a
            Space Wolf knows that he travels a glorious path, and that thousands
            of great warriors have trod it before him.

          </div>
          <p>
            Leman Russ, also known as the "Wolf King" and the "Great Wolf"
            during his lifetime, is the currently missing primarch of the Space
            Wolves Chapter of Space Marines.
          </p>
          <p>
            He led the Space Wolves Space Marine Legion during the Great Crusade
            and the Horus Heresy and is famed in Imperial history for his hatred
            of psychic powers and sorcery, whose use in battle he viewed as
            dishonourable and unworthy of true warriors.
          </p>
          <p>
            After receiving a disturbing vision in 211.M31, Leman Russ
            disappeared with the warriors of his Varagyr bodyguard, his
            destination and fate unknown. He left a single member of his guard
            behind, Bjorn the Fell-Handed, who would become the first Great Wolf
            to lead the Space Wolves in his absence.
          </p>
          <p>
            Russ, along with his brother primarchs Angron and Vulkan, were
            considered to be the greatest warriors one-on-one amongst the
            primarchs. Known for his fierce and sometimes barbaric personality,
            Leman Russ considered himself the Emperor of Mankind's most loyal
            son and executioner.
          </p>
          <p>
            He viewed his role as unquestionably carrying out the punishments
            requited by the Master of Mankind. Among the forces of Chaos he was
            known as "the Brawler."
          </p>
          <p>
            Some recent rumours claim that it is Leman Russ who is the unknown
            force behind the return of the Space Wolves' 13th Company to
            realspace after 10,000 Terran years fighting the forces of Chaos in
            the Warp during the 13th Black Crusade of 999.M41.
          </p>
          <p>
            Several main battle tank variants used by the Astra Militarum have
            been named after him. The Leman Russ tank is the most prominent, and
            several sub-variants of that pattern of tank also exist in
            widespread use in the Imperium of Man, such as the Leman Russ
            Demolisher.
