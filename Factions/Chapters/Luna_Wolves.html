            The Luna Wolves were the XVIth Space Marine Legion raised by the
            Emperor of Mankind on Terra at the dawn of the Great Crusade in the
            late 30th Millennium. After the Emperor rediscovered the Legion's
            primarch Horus in 801.M30 on the world of Cthonia, and gave him
            command of the Luna Wolves, Horus went on to lead the XVIth Legion
            in earning thousands of battle honours over the span of the 200
            standard years of the Great Crusade.
          </p>
          <p>
            Few other Legions could match the Luna Wolves' achievements and of
            those that could, few could rival the XVIth Legion for the
            brightness with which their victories shone. Spread across hundreds
            of expeditionary fleets and on countless battlefields, the Luna
            Wolves broke the enemies of the newborn Imperium and pushed the
            Great Crusade forwards.
          </p>
          <p>
            The position of Horus as the Emperor's favoured gene-son undoubtedly
            enhanced their triumphs. The Emperor fought alongside all of the
            primarchs, and led all of the Legions at different times, but Horus
            and the Luna Wolves stood beside Him for many of His greatest
            victories. The Luna Wolves stood with the Emperor from the beginning
            of the Great Crusade until the Emperor's return to Terra following
            the triumph of the Ullanor Crusade in 000.M30 and the elevation of
            Horus to the esteemed rank of Warmaster and commander-in-chief of
            all the Emperor's vast armies.
          </p>
          <p>
            Yet as the character of any Space Marine Legion was an echo of their
            primarch, one can see the flaws of the gene-father in the pride of
            his gene-sons. Brutal, ruthless and unwavering but also honourable,
            and once loyal to the Imperium beyond question, the history of the
            Luna Wolves is the history of the ambition of the Imperium itself,
            and the flaws that broke its founder's dreams of unification and
            glory for all Mankind asunder.
          </p>
          <p>
            The XVIth Legion was originally known as the Luna Wolves for most of
            the Great Crusade. In honour of Horus' great achievements during the
            latter years of that era after the Imperial victory over the Orks
            during the Ullanor Crusade, the Emperor suggested that the Legion be
            renamed the "Sons of Horus" to honour his most beloved son's
            accomplishments.
          </p>
          <p>
            Horus at first refused, fearing that to so set himself above his
            primarch brothers and would lead to factional strife. Eventually he
            did institute this change, at his brother primarch Sanguinius'
            urging, just prior to the events culminating in his conversion to
            the service of the Dark Gods of Chaos on the world of Davin.
          </p>
          <p>
            After Horus' treachery and final defeat at the Siege of Terra during
            the Horus Heresy, however, the XVIth Legion was renamed the "Black
            Legion" by its new Chaos Lord, Ezekyle Abaddon, better known now as
            "Abaddon the Despoiler," the former first captain of the Legion and
            commander of its elite 1st Company. The new name was chosen after
            the Astartes of the Sons of Horus painted their power armour black
            in grief at the death of their primarch and shame at their failure
            to overthrow the False Emperor and seize control of the galaxy
            during the Siege of Terra.

          </div>
          <p>
            Horus, also called Horus Lupercal, or more simply The Lupercal
            during his lifetime by the Astartes of his Luna Wolves Legion, was
            one of the 20 genetically-engineered primarchs created by the
            Emperor of Mankind from the foundation of His own DNA before the
            start of the Great Crusade to lead the armies of the newborn
            Imperium of Man.
          </p>
          <p>
            Horus was the primarch and master of the XVIth Legion of Space
            Marines, the Luna Wolves, later renamed by him the Sons of Horus. He
            was also the first Imperial Warmaster, the most favoured son of the
            Emperor, and ultimately, the greatest traitor in the history of
            Mankind.
          </p>
          <p>
            Horus' homeworld was the Hive World of Cthonia which lay only a few
            light years from Terra. Horus was thus the first primarch to be
            rediscovered by the Emperor after the Great Crusade began in the
            late 30th Millennium.
          </p>
          <p>
            Horus was responsible for unleashing the horrific civil war known as
            the Horus Heresy upon the Imperium of Man in the early 31st
            Millennium which killed billions of men, women and children in
            pursuit of his mad ambition to overthrow the Emperor of Mankind and
            replace Him as the ruler of the Human race.
          </p>
          <p>
            While Horus ultimately lost his bid for power and was slain by the
            father he had once so loved during the Siege of Terra, his actions
            damaged the Imperium of Man beyond repair and inaugurated the
            current Age of the Imperium, when Mankind is beset by countless
            horrific dangers to its existence and the Imperium itself has become
            a stagnant, repressive, and dehumanising galactic presence.
