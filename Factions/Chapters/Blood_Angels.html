            The Blood Angels are one of the 20 First Founding Legions of the
            Space Marines and were originally the IXth Legion before the Second
            Founding broke the Legiones Astartes up into separate Chapters of
            1,000 Space Marines each.
          </p>
          <p>
            They are well-known across the galaxy for their bloodthirsty nature
            in battle, and feared for the curse of flawed gene-seed they carry.
            The Blood Angels are amongst the longest-living of the Adeptus
            Astartes, with some of the Chapter's Space Marines having served the
            Emperor of Mankind for over a thousand standard years.
          </p>
          <p>
            Due to recent events, the Blood Angels' numbers were severely
            depleted. Under the threat of extinction, and in order to quickly
            replenish their numbers, the Blood Angels were forced to ask their
            kindred Successor Chapters from subsequent Astartes Foundings for a
            tithe of warriors from the related Chapters' pools of neophytes,
            their candidate Space Marines.
          </p>
          <p>
            With these tithes of new recruits, and the recent arrival of the
            Primaris Space Marines during the Indomitus Crusade, the Blood
            Angels were able to replenish their losses, though they still face a
            time of trial like none the Chapter has known since the days of the
            Horus Heresy.
          </p>
          <p>
            The Blood Angels are the noble descendants of that most puissant and
            angelic of the primarchs -- Sanguinius. They are perhaps one of the
            most celebrated Chapters in the entire Imperium, their countless
            heroic deeds and victories known to untold billions of the Emperor's
            subjects across the length and breadth of the galaxy.
          </p>
          <p>
            The beauteous, angelic visages of the Chapter's heroes adorn Gothic
            facades and stained glass windows in a million holy basilicas, and
            their portraits gaze serenely from endlessly copied and much
            cherished illuminated tomes.
          </p>
          <p>
            Yet, hidden from the multitudes, the Blood Angels harbour a terrible
            curse. When their beloved primarch was slain at the hands of the
            Arch-traitor Horus at the very height of the Horus Heresy, every
            Blood Angel was doomed to share a portion of the pain inﬂicted upon
            his ﬂawless form. From that day forth, every Blood Angel has been
            tormented by visions of the last moment of Sanguinius.
          </p>
          <p>
            The older the Space Marine gets, the more frequent and debilitating
            such waking nightmares become. Should he not fall in battle, every
            Blood Angel will one day become so consumed by these soul-searing
            visions that he will descend into a madness in which he must witness
            the death of Sanguinius over and over again, ever unable to
            intervene as the Warmaster enacts his vile treachery.
          </p>
          <p>
            The very inevitability of their curse ennobles the battle-brothers
            of the Blood Angels, driving them ever onwards to a glorious death
            in the name of the Emperor and their primarch. Where lesser men
            might have surrendered to the dark urgings to shed the blood of the
            enemies of the Emperor, the Blood Angels have remained pure and
            noble for ten thousand standard years. Despite this, the Chapter is
            dying, for each year ever more of its brethren succumb to the
            so-called Red Thirst -- the desire to rend limb from limb those
            responsible for the death of Sanguinius, and by extension every
            enemy of the Emperor.
          </p>
          <p>
            The death of Sanguinius represents one of the most perfidious and
            tragic moments of the Horus Heresy, for he died at the hands of his
            brother-primarch, the Arch-traitor Horus. Although some say that the
            sacrifice weakened the Warmaster just enough to allow the Emperor to
            later defeat him at the climax of the Siege of Terra, the death of
            Sanguinius is mourned to this day, and felt keenly by the Blood
            Angels, in whose veins his blood still pumps.
          </p>
          <p>
            When war calls and blood is spilled, the Blood Angels are gripped by
            a fury born of the last moments of their primarch's life. For some,
            the thirst is too great and they are entirely overcome by what is
            called the Black Rage, cursed to end their days reliving their
            beloved primarch's death over and over again.
          </p>
          <p>
            The beatific Sons of Sanguinius are known and celebrated across the
            Imperium, representations of the greatest heroes of the Blood Angels
            carved in marble, painted in oils, and sewn in tapestries in a
            million cloisters and more. Their angel-winged primarch is an object
            of veneration on countless worlds, his perfect visage gazing down on
            the faithful with a mixture of benevolence and pity. The Blood
            Angels are the inheritors of Sanguinius, and they bring death from
            above to the enemies of the Emperor.
          </p>
          <p>
            The Chapter seeks the beauty of perfection in all it does, and in
            one particular field of warfare surpasses all other practitioners.
            While all Chapters of the Adeptus Astartes are masters of the Drop
            Pod and Thunderhawk assault, the Blood Angels have become synonymous
            with the ﬂawless execution of the aerial assault.
          </p>
          <p>
            They employ an entirely new pattern of vehicle of mysterious
            origins: the Stormraven gunship. This vessel appears as a lighter
            cousin of the Thunderhawk, and while its smaller size means it
            carries less weaponry and a smaller troop capacity, it greatly makes
            up for this in speed and manoeuvrability.
          </p>
          <p>
            While the Adeptus Mechanicus took several standard centuries to
            examine and debate the use of the Standard Template Construct
            imprint of the gunship, the Blood Angels saw its worth immediately,
            and set about introducing it into their armoury.
          </p>
          <p>
            Lately, the Chapter's Forge has been able to perfect its fabrication
            methods to such an extent that the gunship is now being used
            throughout the entire force. While the gunship is only just
            beginning to enter service in other Astartes Chapters, the Blood
            Angels are already masters of its use, and they have refined methods
            of aerial assault others are just beginning to learn.
          </p>
          <p>
            The Blood Angels' doctrine of aerial assault culminates in savage
            close combat. Whether they are delivered into battle by Thunderhawk
            or Stormraven gunship, or in the troop bay of an armoured transport
            such as a Rhino, Razorback or Land Raider, the Blood Angels are all
            but peerless in their mastery of close assault.
          </p>
          <p>
            This is in part because the gene-seed of Sanguinius grants his sons
            an incredibly long life span even for Space Marines, during which
            endless solar hours of practise and countless battles hone their
            skills to perfection. Yet, the Blood Angels are not driven towards
            the fury of close assault by tactical necessity or battlefield
            doctrine alone.
          </p>
          <p>
            The Chapter's reliance on blood and the need to cleanse it to keep
            the Flaw at bay exerts a strange and all but irresistible hold on
            the Blood Angels. In battle, the Blood Angels are drawn to spill the
            blood of their foes, and their ordinarily noble countenance can
            occasionally transform into twisted, rage-fuelled masks of savagery.
          </p>
          <p>
            This is referred to as the Red Thirst, and it is something that
            every Blood Angel experiences. For many, the Red Thirst is prelude
            to the ultimate expression of the Flaw, the Black Rage, in which the
            state becomes permanent and all-consuming.
          </p>
          <p>
            The Blood Angels and their Successor Chapters, known as the
            "Sanguinary Brotherhood," are unique in that their gene-seed imposes
            an unusual, and ultimately tragic, ﬂaw upon each battle-brother. For
            most Chapters, service begins as a neophyte, with the initiate
            becoming ever more senior the more battles he survives until the few
            that remain are granted command of a company, become a specialist
            such as a Chaplain, or even become the Master of the Chapter itself.
          </p>
          <p>
            The Blood Angels experience an entirely different journey, though
            few outside of their ranks ever learn of it. The Blood Angels
            possess an almost supernaturally noble, almost saintly countenance,
            their features handsome and pure.
          </p>
          <p>
            This is all the more amazing because the Chapter recruits from the
            short and stunted men of the tribes of Baal, riddled with stigmata,
            lesions, and carcinoma caused by radiation poisoning. Their dramatic
            transformation into the saintly neophytes is only made possible by
            arcane bloodrites.
          </p>
          <p>
            Over a lifespan far longer than that of the average Astartes, the
            Blood Angel hones his skills, yet with each battle he experiences
            something more of the Flaw, the urge to spill the hot, steaming
            blood of his foes growing ever stronger.
          </p>
          <p>
            As it does so, the battle-brother is driven to spend longer periods
            of time purging his own bloodstream within the crimson embrace of
            his transfusion casket. After several standard centuries of service
            he must spend long solar hours within it, having every drop of his
            own blood scrubbed clean.
          </p>
          <p>
            At some point, the Blood Angel is likely to feel the stirrings of
            something deeper, the rage descending not at the culmination of
            battle but before it. These are the first echoes of the Black Rage,
            and while most Blood Angels fall in combat long before succumbing to
            it, those who cannot hold it at bay are forced to enter the
            Chapter's infamous Death Company.

          <p>
            Sanguinius, also known as the "Great Angel" and the "Brightest One"
            during his lifetime, was the primarch of the Blood Angels Legion of
            Space Marines and the genetic ancestor of the Adeptus Astartes
            Chapters who comprise the Sanguinary Brotherhood in the 41st
            Millennium.
          </p>
          <p>
            He was in many ways often considered the noblest and most respected
            of the primarchs, even by his other brothers, including Horus.
            Despite this, he was tragically slain during the climax of the Horus
            Heresy at the Siege of Terra defending the Emperor of Mankind from
            the Warmaster Horus aboard his flagship, the Gloriana-class
            Battleship Vengeful Spirit.
          </p>
          <p>
            Though Horus slew Sanguinius, who had once been his closest and
            greatest friend amongst the other primarchs, Imperial legend holds
            that it was the chink in Horus' armour created by the Great Angel
            that allowed the Emperor to slay the Arch-heretic and thus prevent
            Mankind from falling to the corruption of the Ruinous Powers of
            Chaos.
