            The Iron Hands are a Loyalist Space Marine Chapter and one of the
            original First Founding Space Marine Legions created from the
            gene-seed of their martyred primarch, Ferrus Manus.
          </p>
          <p>
            Like the other Loyalist Astartes Legions, the Iron Hands would later
            be divided up after the Horus Heresy into multiple different
            Chapters, as required by the Codex Astartes, although one Chapter of
            the original Legion remained known as the Iron Hands and is
            described below.
          </p>
          <p>
            Although unwavering in their faith in the Emperor of Mankind and His
            dream of Human unity as embodied in the Imperium of Man, the Iron
            Hands also believe that Human flesh is weak and easily corruptible,
            and strive to replace their organic bodies with more "pure" bionic
            substitutes, thus closely emulating the faith of the Adeptus
            Mechanicus' Cult Mechanicus.
          </p>
          <p>
            The Iron Hands were born as the Xth Legion of Space Marines,
            engineered by the Emperor to bring His light to the long-lost Human
            colony worlds scattered across the stars. Renowned for their pride,
            cold-hearted brutality and remorselessness in battle, the Iron Hands
            were among the most powerful and famed Space Marine Legions of the
            Great Crusade.
          </p>
          <p>
            They were the hammer that had shattered countless foes in the
            Emperor's quest to liberate Mankind from the darkness of Old Night.
            Their primarch was Ferrus Manus, a bellicose and uncompromising
            warlord and peerless weapon-smith, from whom the Xth Legion took
            their name and whose command was to them inviolatable law.
          </p>
          <p>
            When the Horus Heresy first erupted and plunged the newborn Imperium
            into a galaxy-wide civil war, the Iron Hands Legion was too far from
            Terra to intervene directly in the climactic battle of the conflict.
            Their Primarch Ferrus Manus was enraged by the weakness of those
            Legions who fell to Chaos, particularly with his closest brother
            amongst the primarchs, Fulgrim of the Emperor's Children, and by his
            own inability to face the Traitors. Ferrus Manus gathered together
            his most Veteran Astartes and departed for the Isstvan System.
          </p>
          <p>
            It was during the Drop Site Massacre of Isstvan V that the Iron
            Hands, the Raven Guard and the Salamanders Legions were ambushed by
            the Traitors led by the Warmaster Horus, and though the three
            Loyalist Legions fought with extraordinary valour, Ferrus Manus
            himself was lost, beheaded by Fulgrim's Slaaneshi Daemonblade which
            he had uncovered from the xenos world of Laeran.
          </p>
          <p>
            The Iron Hands were undone by their own hubris and the blade of the
            Traitor both, and paid a heavy price in the brutal slaying of their
            primarch and the near-crippling of their strength. Though left as
            one of the "Shattered Legions," the cold fury of the Iron Hands'
            bitter vengeance would afterwards be writ across the stars. While
            the Traitors declared their primarch dead upon the blasted wastes of
            Isstvan V, the current Iron Hands Chapter refuses to accept this,
            for the primarch's body was never recovered. For over 10,000 Terran
            years, the sons of Ferrus Manus have stoked their burning hatred,
            drawing strength from this inexhaustible well of rage as they await
            their lost primarch's return.
          </p>
          <p>
            The unique identity of the Iron Hands is forged by their belief that
            all flesh is inherently weak, for it is subject to mortification,
            decay and temptation and is thus a weakness that must ultimately be
            purged if the Chapter's Astartes are to best serve the Emperor. This
            is a belief most probably rooted in the traumatic experiences of the
            Horus Heresy, but the inherent character of the people of the
            Chapter's homeworld of Medusa, with their stoicism and patient
            forbearance, also plays a part. Following the apparent death of
            their primarch at Isstvan V, the surviving members of the Legion
            returned to their homeworld and fanned the coals of hatred that
            would endure across the millennia.
          </p>
          <p>
            The Iron Hands chose to isolate themselves from many of their fellow
            Adeptus Astartes Chapters after the Second Founding and slowly
            became bitter recluses, wielding their anger as a protective shield
            against a universe of growing weakness and insanity. It soon came to
            pass that none were immune from their ire. The Traitors had
            renounced their oaths and turned against their brothers, but the
            Loyalists had allowed it to happen, and the Emperor had fallen.
          </p>
          <p>
            The Iron Hands of the 41st Millennium ironically harbour a special
            hatred for the Successor Chapters of the other two Loyalist
            Shattered Legions -- the Salamanders and the Raven Guard -- that
            fought with them at Isstvan V, for they believe that if those
            Legions had been stronger and continued to fight rather than
            retreating, Ferrus Manus would not have been lost and the Horus
            Heresy might have ended there. This belief defies all facts to the
            contrary.
          </p>
          <p>
            The Iron Hands' abhorrence of weakness is not limited to the moral
            however, for they hold that the body itself, even that of a
            genetically-enhanced Astartes, is frail and impermanent and subject
            to sickness and aging. The Iron Hands are obsessively driven to
            replace the weak biological matter all Humans are born into with
            cold, unyielding iron, a practise that begins when a neophyte is
            initiated into the Chapter as a full battle-brother.
          </p>
          <p>
            The initiate's left hand is removed and replaced with a bionic
            version in a ritual inspired by a tale of their primarch when his
            own hands were encased in living metal following a legendary battle
            with a great metal serpent on ancient Medusa. Some initiates sever
            their own hand during the ritual, while others plunge it into the
            searing hot lava ﬂowing from the mountains of Medusa, bearing the
            pain and transforming it to hate.
          </p>
          <p>
            Throughout an Iron Hand's lifetime, he grows ever more bitter
            towards his foes and ever more resentful of his own ﬂesh. He appears
            to come to hate himself, or his biological form at least, like a man
            forcibly garbed in filth-encrusted rags. More of his organs and
            limbs are replaced with bionic augmetics, each inherently superior
            to the original. To some outsiders, this is a supreme blasphemy, for
            many of the organs eventually discarded are those that make a Space
            Marine what he is, and which are the direct inheritance of the
            Emperor and the primarch.
          </p>
          <p>
            Nevertheless, a battle-brother of the Iron Hands that has reached
            several standard centuries of service is likely to appear almost
            entirely mechanical, every visible scrap of ﬂesh replaced with
            gleaming, oiled and burnished steel. A few standard centuries more
            and the warrior's biological body might consist of little more than
            his brain and his major internal organs. It is said that some Iron
            Hands, those that survive the rigours of war and their own
            hate-fuelled self-mutilation, are no more than a brain encased in a
            ceramite shell.
          </p>
          <p>
            Because of this compulsive drive, many of the Chapter's leaders are
            entombed within the form of a Dreadnought. These form the Chapter
            council, the so-called "Iron Council," for the Iron Hands have no
            individual Chapter Master. Each company is an all-but independent
            body called a "clan company," which maintains its own mobile
            fortress-monastery that trawls the endless wastes of Medusa guarding
            against weakness in the people and recruiting the strongest
            encountered into its ranks.
          </p>
          <p>
            Some claim that the Chapter's hatred of the ﬂesh represents the
            manifestation of a corruption in its gene-seed, and certainly the
            Iron Hands Legion sired only a few known Successor Chapters.
            Whatever the cause, the Iron Hands' resolution and grim
            determination remain beyond doubt, as many of the Imperium's enemies
            have discovered.

          </div>
          <p>
            Ferrus Manus, also known as "The Gorgon," was the primarch of the
            Iron Hands Space Marine Legion, a master smith known for creating
            weapons that were able to inspire awe in any who saw them, such as
            the sword he created for Fulgrim, primarch of the Emperor's Children
            Legion or the bolter he crafted for Vulkan, the primarch of the
            Salamanders Legion, said to have a barrel designed to look like the
            gaping mouth of a dragon.
          </p>
          <p>
            Ferrus' hands were covered in the metallic substance known as
            necrodermis and he needed no hammer or flame to create beauty
            through metallurgy, using only his exceptionally powerful hands to
            mold and shape molten metal. Ferrus forged his closest bond with his
            brother Fulgrim, but this relationship ultimately ended in tragedy
            after Fulgrim fell to Chaos during the Horus Heresy.
          </p>
          <p>
            During the Drop Site Massacre on the world of Istvaan V at the start
            of the Heresy, Fulgrim decapitated Ferrus with a daemonic sword, an
            action that ultimately marked the point of no return on his path to
            becoming a Daemon Prince of the Chaos God Slaanesh.
