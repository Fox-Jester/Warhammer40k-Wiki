            The Emperor's Children, also sometimes known after their fall as the
            Lords of Profligacy, are a Traitor Legion of Chaos Space Marines who
            devote themselves solely to the service of the Chaos God Slaanesh,
            the Prince of Pleasure, though they were originally the Imperium of
            Man's proud IIIrd Legion of Astartes.
          </p>
          <p>
            The Emperor's Children was the only Space Marine Legion to bear the
            Emperor's own name and His own icon -- the Palatine Aquila --
            granted to them by His hand as a symbol of the Legion's martial
            perfection. Few were ever so honoured amongst the ancient Space
            Marine Legions and given less cause to betray the Master of Mankind
            than the Emperor's Children.
          </p>
          <p>
            Given the plaudits and accolades accorded them, few could doubt that
            they were the embodiment of what the Emperor had intended the
            Legiones Astartes to be: noble in action and aspect, excelling in
            all matters, strong, civilised, firm of purpose and loyal to the
            core.
          </p>
          <p>
            From this height they descended in treachery to the lowest and
            vilest of creatures, enslaved to pride and consumed by hedonistic
            desires that no natural power could fulfill. The Emperor's Children
            are now a scattered Legion much like their counterparts the World
            Eaters, their unity devoured by their allegiance to Chaos. The
            Emperor's Children Legion now exists only as scattered, autonomous
            warbands of Heretic Astartes located in the Eye of Terror who are
            dedicated to their own pursuit of corrupt, hedonistic and usually
            murderous pleasures. The Chaos Space Marines of the Emperor's
            Children are known for possessing outlandish mutations and surgical
            alterations as "gifts" from Slaanesh which are designed to make them
            more "perfect" in the eyes of their twisted patron.
          </p>
          <p>
            The Emperor's Children Legion now exists for no other purpose but to
            exceed every extreme and to know every possible sensation. Its
            warriors are entirely in the thrall of Slaanesh, the Dark Prince of
            Chaos, but once, the Legion of the primarch Fulgrim strived for
            perfection in all they did, and were counted as one of the most
            dedicated of all of the Emperor's followers.
          </p>
          <p>
            The infant primarch of the Emperor's Children grew up upon the
            bleak, dying world of Chemos, a Human mining colony long fallen to
            decay and decline as Old Night claimed the domains of Mankind.
            Isolated from surrounding systems, the industry of Chemos had fallen
            silent, the mines replaced by the reclamation plants and vapour
            extraction facilities that kept the dwindling population from
            vanishing entirely.
          </p>
          <p>
            Within fifty standard years of his arrival on Chemos, Fulgrim had
            risen to become its leader, and it was his dream that the wonders of
            long-lost ages might be rediscovered and rebuilt. However, it was
            only when the Emperor came to his world that the primarch could
            begin to fully realise his vision. By that time, it was not simply
            his homeworld that Fulgrim desired to see elevated to glory, but the
            entirety of Humanity. When Fulgrim was introduced to the Space
            Marine Legion that shared his genetic inheritance, he found not a
            resplendent host as did so many of his brothers, but a mere two
            hundred battle-brothers.
          </p>
          <p>
            A terrible accident had befallen the nascent IIIrd Legion early in
            the development of its gene-seed, setting it far behind its fellows
            in growth and numbers. Thus, it was necessary that Fulgrim and his
            transhuman warriors be integrated into the ranks of another Legion
            until such time as their numbers were sufficiently restored for them
            to take to battle on their own. The Legion to which Fulgrim and his
            warriors were assigned was the Luna Wolves, the Legion of Horus
            Lupercal, and Fulgrim could not have had a better companion at whose
            side to master the arts of warfare.
          </p>
          <p>
            From the earliest days of its service to the Great Crusade, the
            nascent IIIrd Legion was recognised for its drive to attain
            perfection in all its deeds. It was in recognition of this drive and
            their own extraordinary defence of His person during the Proximan
            Rebellion that the Emperor granted the warriors of the Legion the
            right to bear the Imperial Aquila upon their chest armour, a unique
            honour at that time. In recognition that the Emperor was the very
            pinnacle of the perfection Fulgrim aspired to, the IIIrd Legion was
            named the "Emperor's Children," a title it retained even after the
            calamitous events of the Horus Heresy.
          </p>
          <p>
            Some would say that it was Fulgrim's impossible desire to attain
            perfection in all that he did that ultimately led him and his Legion
            into the service of Slaanesh. The exact circumstances of Fulgrim's
            fall are all but lost to history, but certainly, Horus must have
            appealed to his refined sensibilities and stoked the fire of what,
            in retrospect, was an increasingly disturbing quest to attain
            otherwise unattainable heights of sensation.
          </p>
          <p>
            Gifted with the physique and intellect of a posthuman primarch, no
            endeavour was beyond Fulgrim's attainment. Having mastered every
            strategy and tactic of war, he sought ever more esoteric pursuits,
            turning his hand to every creative pursuit imaginable, from poetry
            to sculpture.
          </p>
          <p>
            As his soul was slowly poisoned by the insidious taint of the Prince
            of Chaos, Fulgrim's passions grew ever darker and his drives ever
            more extreme. At the last, acting at the behest of Horus, he
            attempted to persuade his brother primarch Ferrus Manus of the Iron
            Hands Legion that factions within the nascent Imperium were aligning
            themselves against him and his kin, resulting in a bitter
            confrontation between erstwhile brothers. Though Ferrus survived the
            confrontation, the reward for Fulgrim was damnation, setting him
            well and truly upon the road that led to the Emperor's Children
            siding with the Traitors at Isstvan V, and ultimately to the Siege
            of Terra.
          </p>
          <p>
            Though the Emperor's Children were present at the siege of the
            homeworld of Mankind, they were not numbered amongst the formations
            that assaulted the mighty fortifications erected by the Praetorian
            of Terra Rogal Dorn, primarch of the Imperial Fists Legion, to
            defend the Imperial Palace. While the World Eaters and other Traitor
            Legions launched assault after assault upon the palace, the
            Emperor's Children are said to have laid waste to the surrounding
            city and other outlying regions of the Throneworld, slaughtering
            untold thousands, perhaps even millions, of the Emperor's subjects
            in an orgy of unfettered cruelty.
          </p>
          <p>
            Some have even suggested that the Emperor's Children were using the
            unprecedented violence of the Siege of Terra to slay sufficient
            victims to render their vital ﬂuids into some abominable
            distillation, a stimulant that would grant them access to previously
            unheard-of heights of sensation. In the end, the Siege of Terra was
            lifted when the Emperor slew the Arch-traitor Horus, and the
            Emperor's Children were driven from Terra along with the rest of the
            Traitors.
          </p>
          <p>
            Leaving a trail of desecrated worlds and violated populations, the
            Emperor's Children joined the ranks of those Traitor Legions taking
            refuge from the Imperium's wrath within the Eye of Terror, beginning
            a new and devastating series of wars against their erstwhile allies
            among the forces of Chaos in search of stolen mortal slaves to serve
            as their playthings.
          </p>
          <p>
            The history of the Emperor's Children in the period that followed
            the defeat of the Traitor Legions at the Siege of Terra is largely
            obscured from Imperial scholars, for obvious reasons. Perhaps the
            greatest mystery surrounds the fate of Primarch Fulgrim himself, for
            it appears that he disappeared entirely. Some say that the Prince of
            Chaos had already granted him apotheosis in the course of the Horus
            Heresy, and he assumed the mantle of a Daemon Primarch.
          </p>
          <p>
            There are those that claim that Fulgrim has retreated to some Daemon
            World of his own creation, and rules there still, overseeing such
            debased extremes of sensation and experience as no mortal can
            imagine. Some of those who revere Slaanesh regard this mythical
            place as the holy of holies, and spend entire lifetimes obsessively
            questing after it.

          </div>
          <p>
            Fulgrim (pronounced FULL-grim), also known in the time before the
            Horus Heresy as "The Phoenician," is the primarch of the Emperor's
            Children Traitor Legion. He possessed silvery-white hair and was
            quite vainglorious, as his entire life was dedicated to the pursuit
            of perfection in all things; physical, mental and spiritual.
          </p>
          <p>
            Today, Fulgrim is a four-armed, serpentine Daemon Prince of Slaanesh
            who is believed to reside on a Daemon World called Callax somewhere
            within the Eye of Terror or within the Realm of Chaos itself.
          </p>
          <p>
            Unknown to almost all, including his own Chaos Space Marines,
            Fulgrim expressed remorse, repenting his corruption by the Ruinous
            Powers during the Drop Site Massacre on Isstvan V during the opening
            days of the Horus Heresy nearly ten millennia ago.
          </p>
          <p>
            A Greater Daemon of Slaanesh residing within the Blade of the Laer,
            a Chaos artefact wielded by Fulgrim, took advantage of this brief
            mental weakness to possess the primarch's body for a time, but
            Fulgrim used his spiritual imprisonment to further explore the power
            of Chaos and eventually turned the tables on the Daemon and forced
            it into an imprisonment of its own to regain control of his body.
          </p>
          <p>
            Fulgrim emerged from that experience even more committed to the
            pursuit of the path of sensation offered by Slaanesh and Chaos, and
            before the Horus Heresy had ended he was rewarded for his devotion
            with ascension to become a Daemon Prince of the god of excess.
          </p>
          <p>
            His exact location currently remains unknown to the Imperium and the
            majority of the Heretic Astartes of the Emperor's Children Traitor
            Legion who still wander the galaxy in pursuit of their own pleasure
            and Daemonic ascension. Rumours and unconfirmed reports have spread
            since the opening of the Great Rift in the Era Indomitus that
            Fulgrim is active across the galaxy once more.
