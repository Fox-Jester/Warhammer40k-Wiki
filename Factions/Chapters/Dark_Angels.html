          <p>
            The Dark Angels are considered amongst the most powerful and
            secretive of the Loyalist Space Marine Chapters. They were the Ist
            Legion of the original 20 Space Marine Legions to be created during
            the First Founding of the 30th Millennium.
          </p>
          <p>
            Though they claim complete allegiance and service to the Emperor of
            Mankind, their actions and secret goals at times seem at odds with
            that professed loyalty, as the Dark Angels strive above all other
            things to atone for an ancient crime of betrayal committed over
            10,000 standard years ago against the trust of the Emperor during
            the time of the Horus Heresy.
          </p>
          <p>
            The Dark Angels stand first amongst the Space Marine Chapters, as
            they have done since their very inception as the Ist Legion. They
            are a proud Chapter, with traditions and rituals that date back to
            the earliest days of the Imperium of Man.
          </p>
          <p>
            The origins of the Dark Angels remain shrouded in mystery. Few
            Imperial records of the Chapter's beginnings still exist, nor are
            there many mentions of the part it played in the Emperor's Great
            Crusade during the early 31st Millennium. Most references in the
            histories of the Imperium to its deeds during the accursed times of
            the Horus Heresy have actually been expunged.
          </p>
          <p>
            Yet a legend persists that at one point the Dark Angels teetered on
            the very brink of heresy and that an act of the most terrible
            betrayal dishonoured all of the Ist Legion's feats of valour,
            leaving an enduring stain upon all of its Successor Chapters'
            honour.
          </p>
          <p>
            Such is their shame that from that time onwards, the Dark Angels and
            their Unforgiven successors, of which there are more than 19
            currently in Imperial service, strive for absolution from the sins
            of millennia past.
          </p>
          <p>
            The Dark Angels' terrible secret is this: during the Horus Heresy,
            some of their brethren were turned to the side of Chaos. The
            Renegades were defeated in a battle that destroyed the Dark Angels'
            Legion homeworld, Caliban, but many of the Traitor Dark Angels
            survived to be cast through space and time by the direct
            intervention of the Chaos Gods.
          </p>
          <p>
            These survivors are known to those few Dark Angels granted knowledge
            of their existence as the "Fallen Angels" or just "The Fallen." In
            the eyes of the Chapter's leaders, there is only one way that the
            Chapter can ever atone for its shame, restoring its honour and trust
            in the eyes of the Emperor -- all of the Fallen must be found and
            either made to repent their ancient sin, or slain.
          </p>
          <p>
            This story of treachery and betrayal is the Dark Angels' hidden
            shame, and their secret mission to destroy all of the Fallen is now
            their only hope of salvation. No one knows of this other than the
            Dark Angels, their Successor Chapters and, perhaps, the Emperor
            Himself, interred within His Golden Throne.
          </p>
          <p>
            The Chapter has been shaped by its dark past and is secretive and
            monastic in nature, with much time given over to worship and prayer.
            There are many different levels within the Chapter which individuals
            may gradually rise through. On attaining each new level, they are
            granted a little more knowledge of the truth behind the Dark Angels'
            origins, but only the highest-ranking members of the Chapter, the
            members of what is known as the "Inner Circle," know the terrible,
            shameful secret of what occurred 10,000 Terran years ago.
          </p>
          <p>
            The Dark Angels hold more battle honours than almost any other
            Chapter; its only equals are its own successors. The Chapter has
            fought the length and breadth of the Imperium and beyond; against
            every foe that has ever beset Mankind. Dark Angels have held Ork
            WAAAGH!s at bay, crushed planetary uprisings, and saved entire star
            systems from the incursions of the Ruinous Powers.
          </p>
          <p>
            They have fought across searing deserts, in the cold void of space,
            in dense carnivorous alien jungles, and in the depths of the wildest
            underhives. Yet, while Chapters such as the Blood Angels and the
            Ultramarines are lauded wherever they fight, the Dark Angels shun
            laurels and turn their backs upon adulation.
          </p>
          <p>
            Even though the Chapter has stood side by side with every major arm
            of the Imperium's military, it has always maintained a distance and
            aloofness that sets its brethren further apart from the bulk of
            Humanity, and even from other Space Marines. When the Dark Angels
            join a larger force to execute a great war or Imperial Crusade, they
            do so according to their own, unfathomable goals. When a Dark Angels
            force is committed to such a conï¬‚ict, it invariably remains aloof.
          </p>
          <p>
            Its officers keep their own counsel on matters of tactics and
            strategy, and prefer to maintain their own lines of communication
            and supply sources. Even when dealing with the battle-brothers of
            other Astartes Chapters, the Dark Angels often remain sullenly quiet
            at the Space Marine command councils and tactical briefings, though
            that is not to suggest that they are any less effective on the
            battlefield.
          </p>
          <p>
            When the Dark Angels do undertake joint operations alongside other
            Chapters, it is quite common for them to do so with others amongst
            the so-called "Unforgiven" -- the Successor Chapters of the original
            Dark Angels Legion. The successors of the Ist Legion maintain
            especially close relations, their officers all being members of the
            Inner Circle.
          </p>
          <p>
            This mysterious body provides a ready-made command network that the
            Unforgiven Chapters can utilise to great effect when coordinating
            their activities. There is no presumption that the leaders of the
            Dark Angels have any inherent superiority over those of the other
            Unforgiven Chapters. Rather, the leaders work together closely, and
            if needed elect one of their number as nominal commander for the
            duration of the campaign.
          </p>
          <p>
            In one matter, however, the officers of the Dark Angels have
            superiority over those of the other Unforgiven Chapters, through the
            workings of the Inner Circle -- the Hunt for the Fallen. When
            hunting those turncoat Dark Angels who escaped the Fall of Caliban,
            the Unforgiven operate under the auspices of the highest-ranked of
            the Inner Circle, and the very highest of these is the Supreme Grand
            Master himself -- the Chapter Master of the Dark Angels.
          </p>
          <p>
            Through the machinations of the Unforgiven's Inner Circle, its
            members are eternally vigilant, never resting in the hunt for the
            Fallen. Even though knowledge of the Fallen is withheld from the
            majority of the brethren, the results of post-battle debriefings and
            psi-induced stress-purges are fed back to the Inner Circle and any
            sign of the presence of a Fallen analysed.
          </p>
          <p>
            In addition, the Dark Angels' Chaplains are permanently attached to
            a company, and this allows them to hear the confessions of their
            brothers and to keep a close watch for signs of the Fallen. When
            such traces are discovered, the Inner Circle moves without
            hesitation, redeploying Unforgiven forces wherever they happen to be
            and re-tasking them with their new target.
          </p>
          <p>
            In most cases, it is the Ravenwing that locates such activity and
            the Deathwing that delivers the killing blow, but on occasion,
            entire Dark Angels strike forces have been recalled from campaigns
            and committed to engage an enemy that only the highest-ranked of its
            officers have any true knowledge of.
          </p>
          <p>
            While a great deal of the Unforgiven's efforts and resources are
            committed to the Hunt for the Fallen, the majority of the brethren
            have no knowledge of the matter. Rather, the Dark Angels and their
            successors are constantly warned against the words of the Heretic
            and their Chapter dogma extols the virtues of the eternal hunt for
            those who would foreswear the most powerful of oaths.
          </p>
          <p>
            The company Chaplains preach sermons that tell of legendary figures
            betrayed by their own, often having fought in battles far from home.
            Numerous such tales exist, and each is revealed as part of a slow,
            deliberate pattern, the brethren monitored all the while for their
            reaction.
          </p>
          <p>
            Only upon his ascension to the Inner Circle is a battle-brother told
            anything approaching the truth, and even then, there are some
            secrets known only at the very highest tiers. How much of the shame
            of the Dark Angels a battle-brother knows depends upon his station
            within the Chapter and how far the agents of the Inner Circle trust
            him.
          </p>
          <p>
            He may have fought the Fallen unwittingly, believing his foe yet
            another vile Traitor worthy only of death. Perhaps his sergeant knew
            more, certainly his company master did, but he himself almost
            certainly would not.
          </p>
          <p>
            Conversely, there are some higher-ranked brethren who despite
            exemplary service are never inducted into the Inner Circle. Perhaps
            the company Chaplains harbour some small doubt or have reason to
            believe the individual would not be able to bear the terrible truth
            of what occurred during the Horus Heresy. Such Astartes are unlikely
            to progress much further, for at the highest levels of authority the
            Chapter is ever engaged upon the Hunt for the Fallen.

            <h3>Lion EL'Johnson</h3>
            <img src="../../images/Primarch/DA Primarch.webp" alt="" />
          </div>
          <p>
            Lion El'Jonson, often times referred to as "the Lion" during his
            lifetime, known also by the cognomen "The First," and the honourific
            "Primaris Angelus Mortis," was the primarch of the Ist Legion of
            Space Marines, the Dark Angels.
          </p>
          <p>
            Following the events of the Horus Heresy, El'Jonson and his
            crusading fleet returned to his homeworld of Caliban. Inexplicably,
            they were fired upon by the Dark Angel forces garrisoned there under
            the command of his once-trusted mentor and surrogate father, Luther,
            who had been entrusted with the custodianship of Caliban in the
            Lion's absence.
          </p>
          <p>
            Luther would eventually betray the Lion after allowing himself to be
            seduced by the offers of Chaos, rallying a good portion of the Dark
            Angels who had been left behind by their fellows to garrison the
            Legion's homeworld to his cause and attacking the Lion's fleet as he
            returned to Caliban.
          </p>
          <p>
            The titanic struggle between the two former friends resulted in the
            destruction of Caliban and the loss of the Dark Angels' primarch, as
            well as the escape of Luther's allies who had sided with the Ruinous
            Powers.
          </p>
          <p>
            Known as the Fallen Angels amongst their former battle-brothers of
            the Ist Legion, it became the overriding goal of the Dark Angels and
            all of their Successor Chapters (collectively known as the
            Unforgiven) after the Second Founding to hunt down every one of the
            Fallen and get them to repent their betrayal of the Emperor and the
            Lion.
          </p>
          <p>
            Perhaps one of the greatest secrets of the Imperium of Man, known
            only to the Emperor Himself, was that the Lion was still alive and
            resting in stasis, buried deep within the Dark Angels' mobile
            fortress-monastery, The Rock.
          </p>
          <p>
            There he waited, fully healed from the wounds he received during the
            fall of Caliban, to be awakened to lead the Dark Angels in one final
            crusade to save Mankind from all the enemies who threaten it with
            extinction.
          </p>
          <p>
            And in the Era Indomitus, during the Arks of Omen Campaign, that day
            came at last. The Lion now roams the galaxy once more...
