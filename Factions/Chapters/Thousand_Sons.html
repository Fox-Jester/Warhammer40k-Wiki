            The Thousand Sons are one of the Traitor Legions of Chaos Space
            Marines who are sworn solely to the service of Tzeentch, the Chaos
            God of change, intrigue and sorcery, though they were once the
            Imperium of Man's XVth Legion of Space Marines. The main feature
            that distinguishes the Thousand Sons from the other Traitor Legions
            is the sheer number of psyker mutations that have always existed
            amongst the Space Marines in this Legion.
          </p>
          <p>
            Every current member of the Legion possesses psychic abilities and
            they prefer to use Chaos Sorcerers and guile in combat, relying on
            their psychic powers and sorcerous knowledge to earn them victory.
          </p>
          <p>
            As a result of an ancient spell known as the Rubric of Ahriman that
            was cast soon after the Thousand Sons fell from their homeworld of
            Prospero during the early days of the Horus Heresy, every Thousand
            Sons Astartes that lacked psychic powers had his soul fused directly
            into his power armour. The Thousand Sons have become living
            embodiments of sorcery animated by the power of Chaos and the will
            of the Lord of Change.
          </p>
          <p>
            The Thousand Sons are the scions of the Primarch Magnus the Red, the
            copper-skinned cyclops whose thirst for knowledge in all its forms
            led ultimately to damnation and an eternity of servitude to
            Tzeentch, the Chaos God known as the Changer of the Ways. When the
            primarchs were scattered throughout the galaxy, Magnus found himself
            coming to rest upon the distant, isolated colony world of Prospero.
          </p>
          <p>
            It was perhaps fortunate that a being that many other Human
            societies would have denounced as a mutant came to such a place.
            Prospero's only inhabitants were a population of outcast scholars
            and mystics, who had long since ﬂed the galaxy at large to establish
            a refuge where they could practise the arts of the psyker.
          </p>
          <p>
            Raised by such scholars, Magnus learned and mastered every one of
            their arts, soon surpassing them in every regard. The primarch
            turned from pupil to master, his fearsomely powerful mind able to
            manipulate the raw power of the Warp in ways no others could.
          </p>
          <p>
            By the time the Emperor located His long lost son, Magnus was privy
            to every secret the libraries of Prospero could offer. He yearned to
            learn more, and in his sire found the only being with more psychic
            potential than he. Accepting command of the Space Marine Legion
            created using his own gene-stock, Magnus took his place in the Great
            Crusade, and utilised his puissant skills for the good of all
            Mankind.
          </p>
          <p>
            But all was not well with this state of affairs, for the Imperium of
            Man had been envisaged as an end to the superstitions that had
            benighted the isolated worlds of Mankind for so many long millennia.
            The worship of deities and fallacious spiritual doctrines was
            denounced by the Emperor's Iterators, who preached a new age of
            reason fuelled by the potential of Humanity itself and the doctrines
            of the Imperial Truth. Sorcery had no place in such a society, yet
            was not the Emperor the greatest of all psykers?
          </p>
          <p>
            A great debate raged in the upper echelons of the nascent Imperium,
            driven by the need to explain and harness the phenomenon of psychic
            power whilst putting an end to sorcery and superstition. While still
            comparatively rare, the number of Humans being born with latent
            psychic powers was increasing, though it was nowhere near so
            prevalent as it is in the late 41st Millennium. The phenomenon
            proved all but impossible to explain using the empirical reasoning
            on which the Imperium was being built, and eventually, a great
            convocation of the highest ranked and wisest counsellors in the
            Imperium was called.
          </p>
          <p>
            At this Council of Nikaea, those who denounced the use of psychic
            powers stated their case, the Emperor Himself enthroned in
            judgement. At length, Magnus came before the council, and gifted as
            he was of the intellect and charisma of a primarch, he refuted each
            of their points. Furthermore, Magnus stated convincingly his belief
            that no knowledge was in itself forbidden, so long as the scholar
            used it wisely.
          </p>
          <p>
            Both parties having made their cases and the judgement appearing to
            hang in the balance, the Emperor made His decision, partially
            influenced by His anger towards Magnus' continued use of sorcery to
            bargain with the entities of the Warp despite the Emperor's repeated
            warnings to His son of the dangers that lay within the Immaterium.
          </p>
          <p>
            The pursuit of psychic powers would be severely limited and strictly
            controlled, and any incarnation of ritual, superstition or
            incantation outlawed entirely. Magnus was furious, for the Emperor's
            pronouncement severely curtailed his Legion's activities, and denied
            them the use of their most potent weapons of war.
          </p>
          <p>
            And so the Great Crusade continued onwards, but it later became
            apparent that Magnus had not ceased the pursuit of the forbidden
            arts at all, but rather had continued it beyond the sight of his
            peers. Most opposed of all his Brother Primarchs was Leman Russ, who
            regarded any form of guile used to defeat an enemy as a form of
            cowardice, and even after the pronouncements of Nikaea, a bitter
            resentment smouldered between the Legions. It was during the opening
            phase of the Horus Heresy that this resentment exploded into
            something far worse, with tragic consequences for the Imperium.
          </p>
          <p>
            On the eve of the Warmaster Horus' treachery, Magnus is said to have
            experienced a vision in which he saw as no others could the full
            extent of the galactic civil war to come, and the part each primarch
            would come to play in it. He saw brother slaying brother and pacts
            being sealed with unspeakable beings. He saw the Ultramarines being
            unknowingly steered far beyond any hope of intervening, and worst of
            all, he saw what fate awaited the Emperor Himself.
          </p>
          <p>
            Yet, the one thing Magnus could not see was his own role in the
            coming war, but he determined to intervene nonetheless. Magnus knew
            that in warning his sire of the coming treachery he would be
            admitting that he had disobeyed the edicts of Nikaea, yet he
            believed he had no choice.
          </p>
          <p>
            Furthermore, he saw that with events unfolding so fast, the only
            sure way of warning the Emperor was to project his consciousness
            across the void, breaching the psychic defences of the Imperial
            Palace, and to appear before his sire in spirit form. The primarch
            of the Thousand Sons issued his warning, but in so doing revealed
            his own crime.
          </p>
          <p>
            In a stroke, Magnus was condemned by the Emperor, for his message
            had breached the psychic defences of the Imperial Palace and
            catastrophically destabilised the Emperor's Webway Project to build
            an Imperial extension into the Webway for Humanity. Terra itself was
            now at risk of daemonic invasion through the breach created by
            Magnus' folly.
          </p>
          <p>
            The Space Wolves were despatched to Prospero by the Emperor to call
            the Thousand Sons to account and bring Magnus back to Terra to
            answer for his acts, yet what followed must surely have been far
            more destructive than any, even Magnus, could have foreseen.
            Manipulated by the Warmaster Horus, who was already plotting his
            rebellion against the Emperor, the Space Wolves fell upon Prospero
            as savage barbarians, unleashing their bestial anger on the Thousand
            Sons and all of their works.
          </p>
          <p>
            The delicate silver towers of the so-called City of Light, Tizca,
            were cast down as brother fought brother, savage fought scholar and
            warrior fought mystic. At the height of the destruction, Leman Russ
            and Magnus met one another in bitter conﬂict, and ultimately, Russ
            proved the stronger of the brother primarchs.
          </p>
          <p>
            Yet, at the very moment of Russ' triumph, Magnus uttered a word of
            power and caused himself, and the City of Light, to vanish from the
            surface of Prospero, disappearing into the Warp to reappear later
            within the depths of the Eye of Terror on what would come to be
            known as Sortiarius, the Planet of the Sorcerers.
          </p>
          <p>
            Given the heritage of their primarch, it can be no surprise that the
            Thousand Sons Legion was always prone to mutation. Prior to the
            Heresy, stringent purity checks and relentless discipline had kept
            mutation at bay whilst simultaneously developing psychic power.
            Having steeped themselves in the raw power of Chaos, however, the
            Thousand Sons fell prey to rampant and uncontrolled mutation, to
            such an extent that a cabal of the Legion's senior Librarians, led
            by their chief, Ahriman, determined that something drastic must be
            done to save the Legion from complete dissolution.
          </p>
          <p>
            With Magnus retired to the highest tower of his reshaped City of
            Light, his mystic, all-seeing gaze cast bitterly upon the dimensions
            without, Ahriman and his cabal set about enacting a mighty spell
            that would purge the Legion of mutation and impurity, and leave
            behind a body of utterly purified warriors.
          </p>
          <p>
            Ahriman cast his rubric, and the skies over the Planet of the
            Sorcerers erupted in an etheric storm of unprecedented proportions.
            Bolts of power formed from the raw stuff of the Warp arced from the
            roiling clouds, each striking a battle-brother of the Thousand Sons,
            until all but Magnus in his tower and the cabal of sorcerers had
            been scoured by the mighty rubric.
          </p>
          <p>
            But when the storm receded, Ahriman saw the awful truth of what he
            had wrought. Instead of purging the ﬂesh of ravening mutations, each
            of the Thousand Sons who lacked psychic power had been transformed.
            The seals and joints of their power armour had been welded shut, and
            the body within turned to ashes. What remained was a suit of
            animated armour, devoid of mutation, but of all independent will as
            well.
          </p>
          <p>
            When Magnus the Red saw what Ahriman had done, he turned his back,
            ascended his tower and turned his gaze upon the Imperium. In that
            moment he knew that everything he had ever striven towards was now,
            quite literally, ashes.
          </p>
          <p>
            Some say that Magnus resides in his Silver Tower still, his baleful
            gaze sweeping the domains of Mankind in search of the means of
            enacting his final vengeance. While their Daemon Primarch broods
            upon the total annihilation of his enemies, the Sorcerers of the
            Thousand Sons lead their automaton warriors, their Rubricae, the
            length and breadth of the galaxy, wielding the power of Tzeentch and
            enacting the schemes of their master upon the Imperium.

            <h3>Magnus the Red</h3>
            <img src="../../images/Primarch/TS Primarch.jpg" alt="" />
          </div>
          <p>
            Magnus the Red, also known during the early years of the Imperium as
            the "Crimson King" and the "Red Cyclops," is the primarch of the
            Thousand Sons Traitor Legion and an extremely powerful Daemon Prince
            of the Chaos God Tzeentch.
          </p>
          <p>
            A giant in both physical and mental terms whilst still an inhabitant
            of the Materium, the copper-skinned Magnus possessed tremendous
            innate psychic ability, and constantly sought to understand the
            nature of the Warp, becoming a sorcerer of formidable power.
          </p>
          <p>
            Magnus thought he would be able to control the "Great Ocean" of
            psychic energy that was the Warp; however, his prodigious and
            careless application of his psychic gifts eventually caused him to
            fall out of favour with his father, the Emperor of Mankind, as well
            as with the majority of his brother primarchs. His psychic
            immaturity, recklessness, selfish pride and arrogance also caused
            his own undoing, as it eventually brought about his own damnation
            and eternal servitude to the Dark God of Change, Tzeentch.
          </p>
          <p>
            In the end, Magnus led his XVth Legion to the banner of Horus and
            fought on the Arch-heretic's side during the Great Betrayal of the
            Horus Heresy. He survived those events and ascended to the position
            of a Daemon Primarch of Tzeentch as a reward for his service to the
            Changer of Ways.
          </p>
          <p>
            Magnus has spent the majority of the ten Terran millennia since the
            end of the Horus Heresy ensconced atop his tower upon Sortiarius,
            the Planet of the Sorcerers within the Eye of Terror, planning the
            ultimate destruction of the Imperium he believes betrayed him and
            his Legion.
          </p>
          <p>
            Magnus' greatest grudge, however, is with the Space Marines of the
            Space Wolves, who he holds accountable for the destruction of his
            homeworld of Prospero and the corruption of his Legion during the
            early days of the Horus Heresy.
          </p>
          <p>
            During the Siege of the Fenris System the Thousand Sons unleashed on
            the Space Wolves' homeworld in ca. 999.M41, Magnus used the
            sacrifice of the population of the Death World of Midgardia in the
            Fenris System -- destroyed by an Exterminatus action ordered by the
            Great Wolf Logan Grimnar of the Space Wolves after its people were
            infected with a hideous plague engineered by the Daemon Primarch
            Mortarion of the Death Guard -- to fuel the teleportation of the
            Planet of the Sorcerers from the Eye of Terror to a new orbit above
            the remains of the Thousand Sons' lost homeworld of Prospero. This
            ritual restored Magnus and the Thousand Sons to the Materium, and
            created a gigantic new Warp rift in the region that began to spew
            forth Daemons that would make up Magnus' new army.
          </p>
          <p>
            In the Era Indomitus, Magnus has devoted himself to offering a new
            home to Human psykers on Sortiarius where they will be allowed to
            use their powers without the limits and persecution forced upon them
            by the Imperium. This call has gained particular resonance for many
            psykers since the strengthening of all psychic activity in the
            galaxy with the Psychic Awakening brought about by the birth of the
            Great Rift.
