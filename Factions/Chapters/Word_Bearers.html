            The Word Bearers are one of the nine First Founding Space Marine
            Legions that betrayed the Emperor of Mankind during the Horus
            Heresy. They became Chaos Space Marines, their allegiance pledged to
            their Daemon Primarch Lorgar and to Chaos Undivided. The Word
            Bearers were also the first Space Marine Legion to be corrupted by
            the Ruinous Powers of Chaos many solar decades before their
            counterparts turned to the service of the Dark Gods.
          </p>
          <p>
            Through their actions they corrupted the Warmaster Horus Lupercal
            and brought on the terrible galactic civil war of the Horus Heresy
            in all its savagery. Today they bend all their considerable efforts
            towards the overthrow of the "Corpse Emperor" in the Long War and
            spreading the "truth" of Chaos to all Mankind.
          </p>
          <p>
            In the years before the return of Lorgar and the discovery of his
            homeworld of Colchis by the expanding fleets of the Imperium in
            857.M30, the XVIIth Legion was known amongst the vast hosts of the
            Great Crusade by designations other than the "Word Bearers." The
            Emperor named them the "Imperial Heralds" at their inception, an
            elegant title that spoke of the grand purpose for which they had
            been created, whilst their fellow Astartes warriors named them the
            "Iconoclasts," a more brutal appellation coined in appreciation of
            the zeal with which they cast down the idolatrous temples and cultic
            strongholds of Old Night.
          </p>
          <p>
            After the Legion was reunited with its lost primarch, he renamed the
            XVIIth Legion the Word Bearers, which was in line with his belief
            that the Emperor of Mankind was the divine saviour of Humanity. At
            present, the Word Bearers' greatest foes amongst the servants of the
            Emperor are the Ultramarines and their Successor Chapters, who the
            Word Bearers have hated and seen as rivals since the time of the
            Great Crusade.
          </p>
          <p>
            The Word Bearers are the scions of Primarch Lorgar Aurelian, the
            Dark Apostle of Chaos and first of the primarchs to be corrupted by
            the Ruinous Powers. The Word Bearers sought a divine being worthy of
            their veneration, but when the Emperor denounced such practises
            during the Great Crusade, they turned to the Warp and the entities
            of Chaos within.
          </p>
          <p>
            Lorgar grew to maturity upon the planet Colchis, a Feudal World
            under the sway of a single, all-powerful theocratic religious caste
            known as the Covenant. The priests of this primitive faith preached
            that one day, a supreme being would come to lead them into a new
            age. Lorgar was raised within the Covenant's greatest temple,
            learning all its secret rites and texts and compiling a vast body of
            his own wisdom that came to be known as "the Word."
          </p>
          <p>
            When the Emperor finally came to Colchis, the primarch saw in the
            Master of Humanity the divine being spoken of in the ancient
            Colchisian prophecy. Taking his place in the Great Crusade, Lorgar
            led his Legion across the stars, fuelled by a fiery religious zeal.
            Wherever the Legion encountered the idols of any god that might
            rival the Emperor in the devotion of the people, they cast them down
            and ground them to dust, and in their place erected towering
            monuments to the glory of the Emperor, forcing the conquered to
            kneel before them and offer up praises to the new god of Mankind.
          </p>
          <p>
            Yet, such sentiment ran contrary to the Imperial Truth, as the
            Emperor had long denounced the worship of gods and Daemons alike.
            For the Emperor Himself to be held as a god was anathema to all that
            the Imperium stood for, and the Master of Mankind harshly chided
            Lorgar and his kin for their idolatry. Stunned, the primarch
            withdrew for a time, and some have proposed that what followed was
            the root of all of the woe that would subsequently befall the
            Imperium.
          </p>
          <p>
            Exactly what happened can never be known, but it appears that Lorgar
            underwent first a spiritual crisis, and then an awakening. The
            Emperor, who the primarch had counted a god, had denounced His own
            divinity, denying the tenets of the faith in which Lorgar had been
            raised.
          </p>
          <p>
            Confronted by the possibility that the Word was false, Lorgar may
            have sought other meanings within it, and other beings that might
            serve in the place of the god he had believed in. In the Ruinous
            Powers, Lorgar found such beings, and the "truth" was revealed to
            him. The Emperor had been truthful when He had stated that He was no
            god, but Lorgar saw that the Master of Mankind had told the very
            worst of lies when He claimed that no such beings existed.
          </p>
          <p>
            The opposite was true, Lorgar discovered, the Warp filled with
            beings whose power was incalculably greater. Such eternal truths as
            only a primarch could bear were revealed to Lorgar, including, some
            say, the awful reality of the Fall of the Aeldari. Thus were sown
            the seeds of the Horus Heresy, and Lorgar determined that in order
            to avoid the fate that the weakling Aeldari had brought upon
            themselves at the moment of the creation of the Eye of Terror and
            the birth of Slaanesh, Humanity must embrace Chaos in all its glory.
            Only then, Lorgar knew, would Humanity ascend to the pinnacle of
            existence in a universe reshaped and unified with the unbounded and
            unconstrained dimension of the Warp.
          </p>
          <p>
            Possessed of this new knowledge, Lorgar returned to the Great
            Crusade. Where previously the Word Bearers had been criticised for
            their slow progress, enforced by their drive to cast down primitive
            idols and replace them with those of the God-Emperor, now their rate
            of conquest was prodigious. How many cultures brought into Imperial
            Compliance in this closing phase of the Great Crusade were in fact
            turned to the worship of Chaos may never be known, nor the extent to
            which the pernicious inﬂuence of Lorgar's Word was responsible for
            the corruption of the other Traitor Legions. Whatever the truth, the
            Word Bearers stood by the Warmaster Horus' side when he renounced
            his loyalty to the Emperor, and they fought at the very forefront of
            many of the battles of the Horus Heresy.
          </p>
          <p>
            When battle was truly joined, it was towards the Ultramarines Legion
            that the Word Bearers turned the greatest extent of their ire.
            Jealous of the favour they believed the Emperor to have unjustly
            shown Roboute Guilliman's Legion, the Word Bearers set in motion
            plans laid down many Terran years before. At Calth, a world in the
            Ultramarines' domain of Ultramar, the full fury of the Word Bearers
            was unleashed, and it was only after much death and destruction that
            the XVIIth Legion was repulsed.
          </p>
          <p>
            Though it can never be conclusively proven, it appears that Lorgar's
            intentions in committing so completely to attacking the Ultramarines
            was not entirely based on jealousy or vengeance. In so doing, the
            Word Bearers tied up the single biggest Space Marine Legion at a
            time when it was most needed. When the Warmaster's armies closed
            upon Terra, the Ultramarines were thousands of light years away and
            unable to intervene until events were all but decided.
          </p>
          <p>
            In the aftermath of the Warmaster's defeat, the Word Bearers
            retreated to the Eye of Terror, where Lorgar was eventually granted
            apotheosis and ascension to Daemonhood. A large portion of the
            Legion took refuge from the vengeful Imperium within the Maelstrom,
            another region of Warp/realspace interface where only those beyond
            the pale of Humanity dared to tread. From these two fastnesses, the
            Word Bearers plot the corruption of the entire Imperium.
          </p>
          <p>
            The Word Bearers Legion does not venerate any single Chaos God, but
            instead draws strength from multiple sources, enacting vile pacts
            and inviting possession by any power they feel will serve the Word.
            The Word Bearers Legion remains to this day a relatively coherent
            grouping unlike many of the other Traitor Legions, structured after
            the fashion of a vast, hierarchical religion.
          </p>
          <p>
            Alone of all of the Traitor Legions, the Word Bearers field
            Chaplains, called Dark Apostles, though these Arch-heretics preach
            not the glory of the Emperor but of the Ruinous Powers. One of the
            greatest perils the Word Bearers present to the Imperium is the
            taint they so actively seek to spread. While most other Traitor
            Legions fight for their own ends or simply to spill blood, the Word
            Bearers continue the crusade to unite the Materium and the Warp
            their primarch began in the aftermath of the Emperor's censure so
            long ago.
          </p>
          <p>
            The Word Bearers cultivate heresy wherever they travel, subverting
            the Imperial Creed and utilising Chaos Cultists as cannon fodder and
            congregation, often at the same time. Worse still, wherever the Word
            Bearers tread they order the construction of vast edifices and fanes
            dedicated to the glory of Chaos, often enslaving their defeated
            enemies and forcing them to bow down in worship to new, damned gods.
            By such blasphemies, entire planetary populations are lost to
            Mankind, in body as well as soul.

          <p>
            Lorgar, also once called Lorgar Aurelian and the Urizen (Colchisian
            for "wisest of the wise") before the Horus Heresy, is a Daemon
            Prince of Chaos Undivided and the primarch of the Word Bearers
            Traitor Legion.
          </p>
          <p>
            Always determined to uplift Humanity through spreading his deep
            belief in the divine, once the Emperor of Mankind rejected his
            attempts at worship, Lorgar discovered new gods more worthy of his
            devotion, the Ruinous Powers of Chaos, during his infamous
            pilgrimage some forty standard years before the start of the Horus
            Heresy.
          </p>
          <p>
            Lorgar was the first primarch of the ancient Space Marine Legions to
            fall to the corruption of Chaos before the Horus Heresy and it was
            he who ordered the creation of the conspiracy within the Space
            Marine Legions that ultimately led to the corruption of the
            Warmaster Horus upon Davin.
          </p>
          <p>
            Lorgar and his large Traitor Legion of Word Bearers Heretic Astartes
            can be found on the Daemon World of Sicarus within the Eye of Terror
            in the 41st Millennium, from where they plot the overthrow of the
            Corpse Emperor and the conversion of Humanity to the worship of
            Chaos.
